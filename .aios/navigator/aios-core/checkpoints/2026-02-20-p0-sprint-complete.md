## Stories Completed This Session

### 1. BOB-P0-3-FIX-1: Fix Dependency Detection PATH Inheritance

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | **Done** |
| Priority | P0 (BLOCKER) |
| Effort | ~45min |
| Files Changed | 2 modified, 1 created |

**What was done:**
- Discovered TWO bugs in `packages/aios-install/src/dep-checker.js`:
  1. **Import bug:** `const { execaSync } = require('execa')` is `undefined` in execa v5 CJS. Correct: `const { sync: execaSync } = require('execa')`
  2. **ENV bug:** `execaSync` calls missing `env: process.env` option
- Both `checkDependency()` and `checkDockerRunning()` fixed
- 11 unit tests created in `packages/aios-install/tests/dep-checker.test.js`
- Validated: Node.js v20.20.0, Git 2.52.0, Docker 29.2.0, GH CLI 2.86.0 all detected

**Impact:** Unblocks NPX installer for ~70% of developers using version managers (nvm, Homebrew, asdf, etc.)

### 3. BOB-COV-7: Integration E2E Tests

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

**What was done:**
