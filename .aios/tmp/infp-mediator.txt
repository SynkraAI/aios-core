What’s in This Profile?
This profile is designed to cover all the main aspects of Mediators’ personality as it
affects different areas of their life, including Mediators’ key strengths and
weaknesses, relationships, academic path, career and professional development, as
well as their communication and friend-making skills, parenting tips and advice, and
much, much more. It combines personality-type theory with practical, real-world
advice from other people who share the Mediator personality type.
Personality type has been the focus of many discussions, some of them dating back
to ancient times. It’s wise to draw from this source of knowledge and experience,
especially when unsure of how to handle a specific situation. This kind of knowledge
offers the power to control and understand oneself. As Aristotle said millennia ago,
“The hardest victory is the victory over self.” Consider this profile a plan for success.

The Puzzle of Personality

When they receive their personality test results on our website, most people’s first
question is, “What do these letters mean?” We are of course referring to those
mysterious acronyms – INTJ-A, for example, or ENFP-T. As you may have already
learned from the type descriptions or articles on the website, the five letters of these
acronyms each refer to a specific trait, with certain trait combinations forming
various types and type groups. But before we discuss those traits in depth, let’s
explore their historical foundations.
Since the dawn of time, humans have drawn up schematics to describe and
categorize our personalities. From the four temperaments of the ancient civilizations
to the latest advances in psychology, we have been driven to fit the variables and
complexities of human personality into well-defined models. Although we are still
some time away from being able to do that, the current models account for our most
important personality traits and can predict our behavior with a high degree of
accuracy.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

Personality is just one of many factors that guide our behavior, however. Our actions
are also influenced by our environment, our experiences, and our individual goals.
This profile describes how people belonging to a specific personality type are likely to
behave. We will outline indicators and tendencies, however, not definitive guidelines
or answers. Significant differences can exist even among people who share a
personality type. The information in this profile is meant to inspire personal growth
and an improved understanding of yourself and your relationships – not to be taken
as gospel.
Our approach has its roots in two different philosophies. One dates back to the early
20th century and was the brainchild of Carl Gustav Jung, the father of analytical
psychology. Jung’s theory of psychological types is perhaps the most influential
creation in personality typology, and it has inspired many different theories. One of
Jung’s key contributions was the development of the concept of Introversion and
Extraversion – he theorized that each of us falls into one of these two categories,
either focusing on the internal world (Introvert) or the outside world (Extravert).
Besides Introversion and Extraversion, Jung coined the concept of so-called cognitive
functions, separated into Judging or Perceiving categories. According to Jung, each
person prefers one of these cognitive functions and may most naturally rely on it in
everyday situations.
In the 1920s, Jung’s theory was noticed by Katharine Cook Briggs, who later coauthored one of the most popular personality indicators used today, the MyersBriggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®). Briggs was a teacher with an avid interest in
personality typing, having developed her own type theory before learning of Jung’s
writings. Together with her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, they developed a

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

6

The Puzzle of Personality

convenient way to describe the order of each person’s Jungian preferences – this is
how four-letter acronyms were born.
Of course, this is just a very simplified description of the Myers-Briggs theory.
Readers interested in learning more should read Gifts Differing: Understanding
Personality Type by Isabel Briggs Myers. As we define personality traits and types
differently in our model, we will not go deeper into Jungian concepts or related
theories in this profile.
Due to its simplicity and ease of use, the four-letter naming model is now shared by
a number of diverse theories and approaches, including Socionics, Keirsey
Temperament Sorter®, and Linda Berens’ Interaction Styles, among many others.
While the acronyms used by these theories may be identical or very similar, however,
their meanings do not always overlap. As a result, if you meet five people who say, “I
am an INFJ,” their understanding of what that means may vary significantly.
Regardless of its structure, any type-based theory will struggle to describe or
characterize people whose scores lie near the dividing line. A different way to look at
personalities is through the lens of a trait-based rather than a type-based model.
What do we mean by that? Instead of creating an arbitrary number of categories and
attempting to fit people within them, a trait-based model simply studies the degree
to which people exhibit certain traits.
You may have heard the term Ambivert, which is a perfect example in this case.
Ambiversion means that someone falls in the middle of the Introversion-Extraversion
scale, being neither too outgoing nor too withdrawn. Trait-based theories would
simply say that an Ambivert is moderately Extraverted or moderately Introverted and
leave it at that, without assigning a personality type.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

A trait-based approach makes it easier to reliably measure correlations between
personality traits and other characteristics – for example, political attitudes. This is
why trait-based approaches dominate psychometric research, but that’s more or less
the only area where these approaches are dominant. Because they don’t offer types
or categorizations, trait-based theories don’t translate as well as type-based theories
into specific recommendations and takeaways. Assigned categories such as Extravert
or Introvert may be limiting, but they allow us to conceptualize human personality
and create theories about why we do what we do – something that a more
scientifically reliable but colorless statement, such as you are 37% Extraverted,
simply cannot do.
With our model, we’ve combined the best of both worlds. We use the acronym format
introduced by Myers-Briggs for its simplicity and convenience, with an extra letter to
accommodate five rather than four scales. However, unlike Myers-Briggs or other
theories based on the Jungian model, we have not incorporated Jungian concepts
such as cognitive functions, or their prioritization. Jungian concepts are very difficult
to measure and evaluate scientifically, so we’ve instead chosen to rework and
rebalance the dimensions of personality called the Big Five personality traits, a model
that is very popular in psychological and social research.
Our personality types are based on five independent spectrums, with all letters in
the type code (e.g. INFJ-A) referring to one of the two sides of the corresponding
spectrum. We’ll talk more about these concepts in the next chapter. This approach
has allowed us to achieve high test accuracy while also retaining the ability to define
and describe distinct personality types.
During the last few years, we have conducted more than 800 studies to uncover
trends and correlations between personality traits and various behaviors. Many of

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

these studies will be referenced in this profile, and additional information can be
found in our online Academy. Our goal is to give you access to our sources without
repeating ourselves or overwhelming you with information. If you are particularly
interested in a specific study or its statistical characteristics, please feel free to
contact us via our website, and we will do our best to provide additional information.
With that aside, let’s dig deeper into the five personality aspects!

Five Personality Aspects
Mind: Introverted (I) vs. Extraverted (E)
The distinction between Introverts and Extraverts may be the oldest notion in the
history of personality theories. It has long been observed that some people are
expressive and outgoing, while others are reserved, quiet, and more comfortable
alone. The first group recharges by engaging with the external world and
communicating with other people, whereas members of the second group are
energized by spending time alone and connecting with their own inner world.
We focus on these differences in our first scale, which we call Mind. This scale – which
is based on a person’s level of expressiveness and the degree to which he or she
seeks external stimulation – determines how we see and approach the outside world,
including people, objects, and activities. This scale correlates with a number of other
personality traits, such as willingness to volunteer, desire to engage in thrill-seeking
activities, and romantic assertiveness, to name just a few.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

On one side of this scale, we have
Introverted individuals (the I letter in
the

type

acronym).

You

might

associate Introversion with being
private or withdrawn – or even
clumsy or antisocial – but our studies
show a far more complex picture.
Generally speaking, Introverts do
not seek or require much external stimulation. As you might expect, an Introvert
requires less communication with others than an Extravert would, but an Introvert’s
preference for less stimulation can also influence his or her hobbies, political
attitudes, and even eating or drinking habits. To give a practical example, our studies
have found that Introverts are less likely than Extraverts to enjoy coffee and energy
drinks.
But

what

Compared

about

Extraverts?

with

Introverts,

Extraverts are more interested in
engaging with the people, objects,
and environment around them. This
preference manifests itself in many
ways: Extraverts are less sensitive
than Introverts to noise, for example,
and they are likelier to wear bright and colorful clothes. Extraverts not only tolerate
external stimuli, however; they actually need these stimuli in order to support their
own energy.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

10

The Puzzle of Personality

Extraverts are often energetic and willing to take the lead, especially in social
situations. They enjoy pushing themselves to the limit and challenging themselves
and those around them. Unlike Introverts, who are more cautious in their approach,
Extraverts are likely to feel that they can handle life’s challenges without much
forethought. Whether that turns out to be true depends on many other
circumstances, but overall, Extraverts tend to be more proactive in experiencing –
and embracing – the world around them.
Worldwide, the three most Extraverted countries are Oman (61.66%), Yemen
(59.44%), and Saudi Arabia (58.95%). The most Introverted countries are Japan
(59.88%), Lithuania (55.85%), and Portugal (54.25%). In the United States, New York
(50.92%), Mississippi (50.87%), and Illinois (50.64%) top the list for Extraverts, while
West Virginia (53.62%), Alaska (53.6%), and Maine (53.41%) report the highest
percentages of Introverts. Interestingly, if the District of Columbia were included in
the comparisons, it would easily top the Extraverted list. In our study, the average
Extraversion score for the capital city’s 23,310 respondents was 53.06% – significantly
above New York, its closest competitor.
Mediators are Introverted. This is why they enjoy being self-sufficient, prefer working
with ideas rather than people, and don’t need great numbers of friends. They may
even be able to tune out what is happening around them. Socializing depletes
Mediators’ internal energy reserves quite quickly, and when that happens, they need
to return to their home base to recharge.
Again, these are just tendencies and not predestined, unchangeable traits. For
instance, Mediators are perfectly capable of honing their social skills and becoming
experts in negotiation or small talk. Mediators would develop these skills out of
necessity, however, and not due to particular enthusiasm or interest.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

11

The Puzzle of Personality

Energy: Intuitive (N) vs. Observant (S)
Energy is the second scale in our model, and in our opinion it is the most important.
While the other four scales determine how you interact with the world (Mind), make
decisions (Nature), schedule your activities (Tactics), or react to external feedback
(Identity), the Energy scale actually determines how you see the world and what kind
of information you focus on.
All personality types can be divided into those that favor the Intuitive energy style
and those that favor the Observant energy style. Intuitive individuals tend to be
visionary, interested in ideas and abstractions, and attracted to novelty. Observant
individuals, on the other hand, prefer facts, concrete and observable things, and the
tried and true.
It is important to stress that this scale has nothing to do with how we absorb
information: Intuitive and Observant types use their five senses equally well. Instead,
this scale shows whether we focus on what is possible (making connections intuitively)
or what is real (observing the environment). If you are familiar with the Big Five
personality traits, you might recognize this scale as a reworking of the openness to
experience concept, with a focus on preference for (and tolerance of) novelty and
ambiguity.
Individuals with the Intuitive trait rely on their imaginations and think in terms of
ideas and possibilities. They dream, fantasize, and question why things happen the
way they do, always feeling slightly detached from the actual, concrete world.
Although they observe other people and events, their minds remain directed both
inwards and somewhere beyond – always questioning, wondering, and making

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

12

The Puzzle of Personality

connections. When all is said and
done, Intuitive types believe in
novelty, in the open mind, and in
never-ending improvement.
In one 16Personalities study, we
asked people whether they wish
they had been born in the Age of
Discovery (roughly speaking, the 15th
through the 18th centuries). Our results showed that Intuitive types were much more
willing to give up the convenience, comfort, and predictability of modern life in
exchange for the excitement of exploration, distant civilizations, and the
undiscovered mysteries of the New World.
In contrast, individuals with the
Observant trait focus on the actual
world and things happening around
them. Preferring to see, touch, feel,
and experience, they are happy to
leave theories and possibilities to
others. They keep their feet on the
ground and focus on the present,
instead of wondering why or when something might happen. Consequently, people
with this trait tend to be better at dealing with facts, tools, and concrete objects as
opposed to brainstorming, theorizing about future events, or handling abstract
theories. Observant types are also significantly better at focusing on just one thing
at a time instead of juggling multiple activities.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

13

The Puzzle of Personality

The Energy scale influences communication style as well. Intuitive individuals talk
about ideas and have no difficulties with allusions or reading between the lines, while
Observant types focus on facts and practical matters. This is why Intuitive types may
find it challenging to understand someone with the Observant trait, and vice versa.
Intuitive types may think that Observant individuals are materialistic, unimaginative,
and simplistic, and Observant types may see their Intuitive conversation partner as
impractical, naïve, and absent-minded. These assumptions and biases can be quite
damaging, and it takes a mature person to get past them.
Geographically, the Middle East and Asia have the largest percentage of Observant
individuals, with 8 countries in the top 10 list. Saudi Arabia (71.94%), Oman (71.03%),
and Yemen (69.76%) have the top scores among Observant countries, while Nepal
(48.92%), Albania (48.51%) and Maldives (48.44%) top the Intuitive table.
In the United States, North Dakota (59.43%), Minnesota (59.23%), and Iowa (59.04%)
are the most Observant states. On the opposite side of the table, we have Nevada
(43.92%), Rhode Island (43.75%), and West Virginia (43.47%).
Mediators are Intuitive individuals. This is why they are so good at seeing possibilities
and honoring different points of view. People with this personality type spend more
time engaging in various internal discussions than observing things around them.
Mediators are not that concerned about what is happening; instead, they focus on
what might happen or why something has happened. Mediators hone this focus
throughout their lives, which makes them passionate and insightful thinkers.
Of course, every stick has two ends, and focus on novelty and change comes at a cost.
By directing their mental resources toward possibilities and the future, Mediators
inevitably lose sight of what is happening around them. They may have difficulties

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

14

The Puzzle of Personality

dealing with practical matters or data. If they aren’t paying attention, they may even
miss something right under their nose. Because the majority of the population has
the Observant trait, Mediators may have difficulty finding a partner and connecting
with others.

Nature: Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
The third scale, which we call Nature, determines how we make decisions and cope
with emotions. While we all have feelings, there are significant differences in how
different types react to them. This scale influences a number of areas of our lives,
particularly our interactions with other people.
People with the Thinking trait seek
logic and rational arguments, relying
on their head rather than their heart.
They do their best to safeguard,
manage, and conceal their emotions.
“Whatever

happens,

you

must

always keep a cool head” – this is the
motto of Thinking individuals. These
types are not cold-blooded or indifferent, however. People with the Thinking trait are
often just as emotional as those with the Feeling trait, but they subdue or override
their feelings with their rational logic.
In several of our studies, we analyzed the attitudes of different personality types
toward philanthropy and charitable causes. Thinking types are significantly less likely
to engage in charitable giving or to be touched by charities’ emotional appeals. Does
this mean that they are unwilling to help? Not necessarily. It turns out that Thinking
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

15

The Puzzle of Personality

personalities don’t believe that giving money to charity is the best way to make a
difference. They may look for other ways to be of assistance – for example, investing
in education for the disadvantaged.
In contrast, people with the Feeling trait follow their hearts and care little about
hiding their emotions. From their perspective, we should not be afraid to listen to
our innermost feelings and share them with the world. These individuals tend to be
compassionate, sensitive, and highly emotional. They would rather cooperate than
compete, although they are not naïve or easily swayed.
In fact, people with the Feeling trait
are likely to fight tooth and nail for
their values and beliefs. For many
Feeling types, principles and ideals
are much more important than, say,
professional success. Although this
perspective might not seem rational,
Feeling types generally adhere to
their own highly individualized – and perfectly valid – logic.
Worldwide, Iran (51.91%), Georgia (50.74%), and Albania (48.94%) report highest
scores on the Thinking side of the scale. On the Feeling side, we have Singapore
(61.41%), Australia (60.1%), and New Zealand (59.98%).
In the U.S., northern states tend to be slightly more Feeling, but not significantly so.
One interesting example is the contrast between Utah and Nevada: two neighboring
states that are each first on opposite sides of the scale. In Utah, the average score is
61.19% on the Feeling side, well above Minnesota (59.61%) and Idaho (59.54%), which

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

16

The Puzzle of Personality

take second and third place, respectively. Nevada, on the other hand, is the most
Thinker-heavy state in our study, with its 34,576 respondents getting an average
score of 42.99% on the Thinking side of the spectrum. While that still means Feeling
personality types outnumber Thinking types significantly, we rarely see such
differences between neighboring regions. Other top Thinking states include
Delaware (42.71%) and New Mexico (42.7%).
Mediators have the Feeling trait – they trust and prioritize feelings, relying on moral
and ethical arguments, and doing everything they can to stay true to their deeply
held principles. People with this personality type are kind and sensitive, always able
to find something positive regardless of the circumstances. The Intuitive and Feeling
traits form the core of the Mediators personality, making them very insightful,
idealistic and open-minded individuals, capable of amazing feats, especially in fields
related to morality, philosophy or diplomacy. However, they also push Mediators
away from the majority of the population, sometimes making it difficult for them to
relate to other people, especially when it comes to accepting what they see as egoism
and self-interest.

Tactics: Judging (J) vs. Prospecting (P)
The Tactics scale determines how we approach planning and how we handle
available options. The implications reach well beyond our calendars, however. At its
core, this scale determines our attitudes toward certainty and structure in our lives.
People with the Judging trait do not like to keep their options open. They would rather
prepare five different contingency plans than wait for challenges to arise. These
individuals enjoy clarity and closure, always sticking to the plan rather than going
with the flow. It’s as if Judging types keep a mental checklist, and once a decision is
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

17

The Puzzle of Personality

crossed off that list, it is not open to reassessment. This mentality applies as much
to grocery shopping as it does to life goals, like buying a house.
Individuals with the Judging trait
tend to have a strong work ethic,
putting

their

duties

and

responsibilities above all else. Our
research indicates that Judging types
are also strict when it comes to law
and order. Of course, this doesn’t
mean that Prospecting individuals
are lawbreakers, but if you see someone go out of his or her way to use a crosswalk,
that person is likely a Judging type.
In contrast, Prospecting individuals are flexible and relaxed when it comes to dealing
with both expected and unexpected challenges. They are always scanning for
opportunities and options, willing to jump at a moment’s notice. People with this trait
understand that life is full of possibilities, and they are reluctant to commit to
something that might prove an inferior option in the future. They also focus more on
what makes them happy than what their parents, employers, or teachers expect. If a
specific task is not particularly
important

or

interesting,

a

Prospecting individual will always
come up with something better to
do.
Looking at the geographical data,
the global Judging-Prospecting chart

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

18

The Puzzle of Personality

has interesting similarities with the Extraverted-Introverted one. While these scales
do not influence each other from a statistical perspective, many of the countries
topping the Extraverted-Introverted charts have correspondingly high JudgingProspecting scores. At the top of the Judging table we have Oman (58.05%), Yemen
(57.78%), and Kuwait (55.8%), while the most Prospecting countries are Japan
(55.21%), Nepal (53.74%), and Lithuania (53.62%).
The map of the United States, however, does not show significant overlaps between
these two scales. On the Judging side of the spectrum, we have South Carolina
(51.05%), Alabama (50.97%), and Tennessee (50.8%). On the other side, the most
Prospecting states are Alaska (51.2%), Vermont (50.86%), and West Virginia (50.76%).
Mediators are Prospecting individuals, and look for different ways to complete tasks
or accomplish goals. Mediators’ vast range of interests may lead to unfinished
projects or missed deadlines, but these types would rather risk disappointing others
than lock themselves into a position where existing commitments would limit their
freedom. Mediators tend to be removed from the real world, often paying far more
attention to their latest mental exercise than to clutter around the house or dishes
piled in the sink. Prospecting types are relaxed about their work or studies, refusing
to get stressed about deadlines, templates, or rules when they still have free time.

The Puzzle of Personality

Identity: Assertive (-A) vs. Turbulent (-T)
The last scale, Identity, affects all others, reflecting how confident we are in our
abilities and decisions. In a way, this scale acts as an internal sensor, reacting to the
input we get from our environments – for instance, success or failure, feedback from
others, or pressure caused by unexpected events. The Mind and Identity scales are
the alpha and the omega of our model, acting as an external shell that we wear in all
of our interactions with the outside world. Later, we will discuss the four possible
combinations of these traits, which we call “Strategies,” but in the meantime, let’s
take an in-depth look at the Identity
scale.
Assertive

individuals

are

self-

assured,

even-tempered,

and

resistant to stress. They refuse to
worry too much, and they don’t push
themselves too hard when it comes
to achieving goals. Similarly, they are
unlikely

to

spend

much

time

thinking about past actions or choices. According to Assertive types, what’s done is
done and there is little point in analyzing it. Not surprisingly, people with this trait are
generally satisfied with their lives, and they feel confident in their ability to handle
challenging and unexpected situations.
In contrast, Turbulent individuals are self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They
experience a wide range of emotions and tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic,
and eager to improve. Always feeling the need to do more, have more, and be more,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

20

The Puzzle of Personality

Turbulent types may forget how
exhausting this dissatisfaction can
be – both for themselves and for the
people around them.
While the Assertive variant may
seem more positive on the surface,
that is not necessarily the case.
Turbulent

individuals

are

more

willing than Assertive types to change jobs if they feel stuck in their current roles, and
they think deeply about the direction of their lives. Turbulent individuals may also
outperform Assertive types in certain instances, because they may care more about
the outcome. The willingness of Turbulent types to push themselves may ultimately
enable them to achieve their goals.
Worldwide, Japan is by far the most Turbulent country, with an average score of 57.48%
on the Turbulent side. Italy (53.8%) and Brunei (52.89%) come in second and third,
respectively. On the Assertive side of the spectrum, we have Uganda (57.91%),
Barbados (57.11%), and Nigeria (57.01%).
In the United States, there is a clear east-west divide, with the East Coast being
significantly more Turbulent. West Virginia (49.3%) takes the lead on the Turbulent
side, followed by Rhode Island (48.84%) and Maine (48.73%). The most Assertive
states are New Mexico (54.7%), Colorado (54.66%), and Hawaii (54.28%).

Type Groups
Now you know what each type consists of. But how do they fit together?

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

21

The Puzzle of Personality

Our system has two layers: the first (inner) one defines our Roles, the second (outer)
one, our Strategies.

Roles
The Role layer determines our goals, interests, and preferred activities. Each of the
four Roles covers a set of personality types that are very similar, and we will use these
groups later in this profile to draw contrasts and similarities between personalities.
They also serve to highlight the importance we have placed on the Energy trait. Each
personality type will share either the Observant or the Intuitive trait with all other
members of their group, as well as one other key trait. Mediators belong to the
Diplomat Role group, along with three other personality types: Advocates,
Protagonists, and Campaigners.

Analysts
Shared traits: Intuitive and Thinking
The personality types in the Analyst Role – Architects, Logicians, Commanders, and
Debaters – embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological pursuits.
The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive trait lets them apply
their minds to almost anything, with their imaginations aiding calculated, strategic
thinking, or seeing just how far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought
experiment.
These personalities are driven to understand and create, and have no problem
switching between speculative musing and frank, solutions-oriented approaches to
whatever problems are at hand. Broad, intelligent vision gives Analysts an ingenious

The Puzzle of Personality

air, but they can become overwhelmed and scattered if they don’t learn to hone
these abilities and use them to advance a worthwhile cause or project.
The biggest pitfall is that their intellect can give them a false sense of accomplishment.
They tend to prefer the world of ideas to the sober reality of follow-through, and by
assuming the role of critic instead of participant, Analysts sometimes risk being
functionally outpaced by those who simply sit down and do the work. They can earn
themselves the unsavory title of “armchair analysts” while those with more real-world
experience continue to create real results. Analyst personality types can lack a proper
respect for those of simpler vision and expression, whatever their background, and
it can hold them back.
Analysts value their intellect above all else, and it can be a challenge convincing them
it’s worth checking their many hypotheses with an experiment or proper evidence to
be sure. To many Analysts, if something makes sense in their minds, that’s as good
as proved, and a great deal faster. Analysts can be brilliant, but they’re still human;
under the influence of ego, these personality types can get in the habit of advancing
clever opinions instead of objective facts.
Analysts’ positive self-identity stems largely from their formidable drive to learn, and
their clever and sharply witty banter can make them excellent debate partners. Often
insatiable readers as well, Analysts can be found stockpiling books, questioning
teachers, and driving conversations in forums across the world wide web. These
types prefer their own processes and pace, and are energized by exercising their
minds on their own time.
Analysts are also relentless self-improvers. Once they’ve recognized a flaw, they
apply all of this cold rationality, honest reflection, imagination, and desire for results

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

23

The Puzzle of Personality

to make it right. Analysts’ forceful, imaginative vision, when trained and focused,
enables these personalities to conceive and accomplish things most thought
impossible.

Diplomats
Shared traits: Intuitive and Feeling
Diplomats – Advocates, Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners – tend to be warm,
caring, and generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These
personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord only as a
step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities seemingly go deeper than the
traditional senses – it’s as if they have a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can
resonate with people’s emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep
connections with others.
This is not as mystical as it can seem. Diplomat personalities deeply value
understanding, and a lifetime of self-reflection grants them insights into others’
motivations that they might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this
to shape the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use this for
ill.
Diplomats’ people skills nurture friendship and healing with pure, genuine empathy.
Causing distress feels to them like wounding their own psyche, so they prefer to
gently nudge loved ones and strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find
the ideals of humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth
warm them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types envision a
prismatic, kind world.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

24

The Puzzle of Personality

The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes Diplomats
sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal world. They can be aggressive
against forces they perceive as evil, and are capable of steely action when they feel
they have moral high ground. Diplomats’ sensitive emotions may flare to outright
combativeness if provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these
personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump rationality
unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very causes they hold dear,
however justified the outrage.
Tempering this passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are
often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking in empathy,
and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They find greater satisfaction in
abstract self-exploration and understanding the issues that affect those least able to
defend themselves than mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks.
Diplomats emphasize experience and understanding rather than calculable
achievement.
Among friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring to
brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange of thoughts and
feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend themselves in this more
personal aspect of their lives as well – emotionally, physically, or even financially.
Diplomats’ open hearts make them vulnerable when others aren’t as considerate,
though they wouldn’t have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will
almost always be the volunteer.
Diplomats embrace travel as readily as anyone – they like exploring other cultures
and people’s colorful ways. These personality types are creatively inclined, often
practicing artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where others

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

25

The Puzzle of Personality

see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive attitudes, they also
appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure expression of a way of thinking and being.
Diplomats can be passionately inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater,
nature, and anything else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their
eyes.
Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world around them with
progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel connected to forces they may
not fully understand, a deep sense of faith that may express itself, if not always
through traditional religion, as spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an
underlying idealism and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the
arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They have a conviction
to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible rewards felt in the heart and soul.

Sentinels
Shared traits: Observant and Judging
Sentinels – Logisticians, Defenders, Executives, and Consuls – are cooperative and
practical. Their grounded approach helps them feel comfortable with who they are,
defining themselves not by individualism, but by character and competence. These
personality types seek order, security, and stability, and tend to work hard to
maintain the way of things, leading to a deserved reputation as the core of any group
or organization, from family to church to the office and the factory floor.
These types embrace teamwork, but expect the same performance and
respectability from others that they strive for themselves. Sentinels often dislike
strident nonconformity because they envision progress through collaboration and
hard work within a known set of rules – to let everyone do their own thing on a whim

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

26

The Puzzle of Personality

would be anarchy. Sentinels prefer proven methods and honest accomplishment to
self-indulgent exploration and esoteric ideas. Because these personalities are deeply
prudent, they also tend to be self-motivated, and rarely need external inspiration to
be productive.
Their grounded perspective leaves little room for random musings, but Sentinels are
not unimaginative. They experiment for anticipated gain rather than intellectual
thrills, and excel in making challenging situations work. Revolution does not appeal
to people from this Role, who tend to learn from the past and remain loyal to the
tested truths and traditions they were brought up with. Where some see fascinating
philosophy, Sentinels may see preposterousness: these personality types favor
practiced methodology over abstract theory.
Having authority allows Sentinels to practice their virtues. Effective in leadership
roles, these types motivate others by energetic example and feel satisfaction from
guiding a well-functioning group – they tend to make excellent teachers, managers,
and community officials, as well as parents and hosts. These personalities are
meticulous and traditional, excelling in logistical and administrative fields with clear
hierarchies and rules as well. Opting for successful completion whenever they can,
Sentinels can be controlling, but gladly compromise when needed to get things done.
Sentinels feel rewarded by shepherding others, and enjoy coordinating and sharing
fun social experiences with friends and family. They believe it is their responsibility
to give their families safe, happy lives that prepare them for the real world. An
appreciation of strong relationships allows them to share generously with those they
respect and love – these types feel bolstered by having reliable people in their lives,
and will do what they can to make sure they hold up their end of the bargain.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

27

The Puzzle of Personality

Birthdays, dinner parties, and camping trips are delightful events under their
enthusiastic direction.
These personality types are happiest without drama, though their admirably
stubborn loyalty can certainly attract it if they feel they need to stand by a friend,
regardless of whether they’re in the right or wrong. Inconsistent people can test
Sentinels’ tolerance and provoke harsh judgement. Sentinels tend to prefer
predictability over novelty and familiar pleasures more than cutting-edge excitement.
It can be difficult for Sentinel personalities to accept people who lack their studious
ideals, but they often respond as engaged and caring mentors to those who wish to
grow in that direction.

Explorers
Shared traits: Observant and Prospecting
Explorers – Virtuosos, Adventurers, Entrepreneurs, and Entertainers – possess a selfreliant mix of enthusiasm, quick thinking, and ingenuity that can lead to impressive
personal and professional accomplishments. Comfortable with uncertainty and
minimally concerned with preparation, these personality types simply adapt and
overcome as events present themselves. Explorers’ flexibility helps them make snap
decisions in the moment, and they’re unlikely to dwell on the future or the past.
They aren’t obsessed with precise detail (unless they’re really in the zone, in which
case they can muster a level of precision and focus that would make a seasoned
engineer blush). Usually, they require workability rather than perfection. Explorer
personalities are utilitarian masters of diverse tools and techniques, ranging from
instruments and engines to the art of persuasion, and they distinguish themselves in
crises, crafts, and sales.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

28

The Puzzle of Personality

This versatile decisiveness doesn’t mean commitment, however. Explorers can
change their minds with minimal regret or second-guessing. People in this Role
dislike monotony, and often feel tempted to stray from obligations in favor of
entertaining new things. They experiment with many interests and live and breathe
whatever they connect with – for a time. If these personality types sometimes leave
business unfinished, let clutter build up, or misplace important things, it’s because
they’ve moved on to something fresh.
Explorers enjoy being free of obligations, where they can indulge themselves or their
interests on their own time. An Explorer might design and build their own dream
house, enthralled with the process, but end up procrastinating on simple repairs
after a few years. They are highly motivated when steering themselves through
something interesting, but don’t like being restrained by anything “mandatory.”
Their relaxed, free-form attitude makes Explorer personalities socially dynamic as
well. They often seek out people and experiences that cater to their senses, finding
more pleasure in stimulation than planning. They happily approach appealing
strangers and interesting experiences, and when things get in the way of a good time,
they apply their ingenuity to getting around it. Explorers want to see what happens
next!
The same themes run through their friendships and families, though these
relationships have much more staying power than most other interests. Rather than
forcing relationships into or out of existence though, Explorers let things flow
naturally according to their desires. Compatible people simply become a part of their
lives. These personality types tend to be individualistic and freedom-loving, going
their own way with little regard for naysayers, but they do enjoy knowing that the
people they trust will be around in the end.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

29

The Puzzle of Personality

Explorers are highly spontaneous, connecting with and adapting to their
environment in a way that is almost childlike in its wonder and sheer fun. It can be a
challenge for them to work for things with a distant or unexciting payoff, as they need
a sense of immediacy to feel truly engaged, but when they are passionate, Explorer
personalities can move heaven and earth.

Strategies
The Strategy layer reflects our preferred ways of doing things and achieving our goals.
There are four strategies: Confident Individualism, People Mastery, Constant
Improvement, and Social Engagement. Depending on their type variant, Mediators
fall under either Confident Individualism (Assertive Mediators) or Constant
Improvement (Turbulent Mediators).

Confident Individualism
Shared traits: Introverted and Assertive
Confident Individualists typically trust in themselves, and they often embrace
solitude to pursue their own interests rather than seeking out social activity.
Fascinated by personal projects, people following this Strategy often have an
impressive range of skills and interesting ideas. But projects are usually only pursued
for their own merit – Confident Individualists tend to feel that social displays and
bragging are time and energy wasted. These personality types are proud of who they
are, what they know, and what they can do, but they don’t feel the need to prove
themselves to others.
Confident Individualists engage their internal inspiration instead of searching for
motivation outside themselves. They favor privacy, and aren’t particularly fond of
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

30

The Puzzle of Personality

interacting with society, whether in a strictly social sense or when embracing broader
societal goals. These personalities often favor substance over superficiality and
personal honesty over playing along, and prefer a utilitarian approach, even when
pursuing esoteric goals.
This utilitarianism also means that Confident Individualists are not easily drawn into
emotional drama. They hold their own opinions firmly, but tend to see little reason
to try to convince others. When drama does arise, these personality types express
their truth with little concern over whether they’ll cause friction or offense. Confident
Individualists tend to endorse self-reliance over cooperation, and are rarely
pressured into agreeing with or lending support to others unless they believe in the
cause.
This relaxed self-assurance means that Confident Individualists may not push their
boundaries. Their live-and-let-live attitude goes both ways: they don’t need to
convince others, and they tend to expect others to return the favor. While highly
capable, they can miss information and opportunities that challenge their views
because they simply don’t place much importance on factoring in others’ approval.
They can be tolerant in disagreement though, respecting others’ individualism just
as they respect their own.
When these personality types form friendships, they tend to be strong and honest.
Because these types don’t feel like they need other people’s approval, their loyalty
and affection is a deliberate expression of affection. Impressing a Confident
Individualist earns their respect and care, and these types make for dedicated,
passionate friends.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

31

The Puzzle of Personality

Self-reliance is central for these types, and they handle difficult situations well
because they tend to be emotionally secure, bold, and resistant to stress. They rarely
seek leadership or the spotlight, but when they do find themselves in these positions,
these personalities lead by an example of self-determination and uncomplicated
honesty – they appreciate grace, class, and form, and rarely seek to impress by
appearances alone. When acting with knowledge and wisdom, Confident
Individualists can be noble pillars of strength.

People Mastery
Shared traits: Extraverted and Assertive
People Masters are highly stress-resistant, maintaining confidence through life’s
challenges, social pressures, and any questions of their capabilities. These
personality types seek social contact and have solid communication skills, feeling at
ease when relying on or directing other people. People Masters’ mantra is fearless
engagement – to be is to do. This is not a group known for its timid opinions or
idleness.
People Masters feel rewarded by stimulation and challenging experiences. They like
travelling to see things, people, and places, where they can experience a richer
understanding of the world around them. These personalities like sampling new
foods, lifestyles, and cultures; even things they don’t end up liking can be entertaining
excitement for them.
Sometimes, though, People Masters are too confident. Insulated against self-doubt
and the need to prove themselves, they don’t always test, or even consider, their own
limits or ambitions. They can slip into a pattern of endless fun and comfort-seeking,
rolling their eyes at those who press themselves towards more intimidating goals. At

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

32

The Puzzle of Personality

the other end of the spectrum, these personality types can just as easily ignore
sensible caution, putting themselves in extraordinary and dangerous situations,
confident they can find their way through.
Most fall somewhere in the middle, embracing healthy ambition and competition so
long as they play a meaningful part in social circles and leadership. Social interaction
plays a big part in People Masters’ happiness. While not dependent on people’s
approval for emotional security, they appreciate acclaim for their accomplishments
and bright personalities, and can be a touch showy from time to time. These types
are self-confident, but they are often lost without people to lead, laugh with, and love.
Their charisma, self-assurance and boisterousness can sometimes be trying qualities.
People Masters prefer cooperation, but have few qualms about dominating their
opposition to achieve their goals, boldly promoting themselves and using their social
skills to get ahead. This Strategy understands people’s needs, but can just as easily
use this as a weapon rather than a tool of compassion if they have their sights set on
something big.
People Masters can compromise when needed, but these personality types tend to
be better talkers than listeners. They can be very demanding, criticizing people’s
performance regardless of their feelings because they expect no less of themselves.
That said, these types are moderate in their disagreements because their ego and
confidence aren’t at stake the way they often are for Turbulent Strategies. People
Masters are not fond of grudges, content to let bygones be bygones. They are more
likely to be socially idealistic, with the intent of bringing people together to make
things happen – petty grievances just get in the way.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

33

The Puzzle of Personality

People Masters’ charismatic virtues shine in social contexts, and these types have
little fear of rejection and a passion for inclusion. They prefer to take the lead, but
sharing the journey through other people’s eyes enhances their own enjoyment as
well. People Masters share in all aspects of people’s lives, making these personalities
strong, honest friends, parents, spouses, and colleagues, serving as wellsprings of
energy, joy, and mutual success.

Constant Improvement
Shared traits: Introverted and Turbulent
Constant Improvers are sensitive and contemplative individuals who enjoy having
their own space and freedom. They are often deep and creative individuals, though
often tense and more comfortable on their own than mixed up in the judgment of
the real world. With the two personality traits most representative of a sensitivity to
their environment – Introversion and Turbulence – they are reserved when dealing
with strangers or new situations, often turning inwards or focusing on peacekeeping
instead.
These personalities’ caution in the face of unfamiliar challenges can sometimes look
like a lack of motivation, but this is usually just self-doubt – Constant Improvers have
a strong drive, but it comes paired with a strong fear of failure. They invest a great
deal of their identity in their successes, and even a minor misstep or embarrassment
can be crushing.
The vigilance learned from a lifetime of ups and downs gives these personality types
a knack for sensing trouble. This is a strategic wariness that can be quite useful in
situations that need to balance risk and reward, whether a financial investment or a
romantic opportunity. Though they can seem frustratingly over-cautious to others,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

34

The Puzzle of Personality

Constant Improvers would rather not face calamity, so they excel at avoiding it with
preventive insights.
Since they aren’t always comfortable with energetic exchanges with other people,
Constant Improvers often direct their attention elsewhere, striving to master hobbies,
careers, bodies of knowledge, or new means of self-expression. Their restless drive,
self-doubt, and solitary mentality can combine to create impressive, beautiful results.
High-achieving and perfectionistic, Constant Improvers generally try to do their best
in their endeavors, dedicating tremendous time and energy. These personalities can
put so much pressure on themselves that they diminish their own impressive
accomplishments by fixating on the slightest flaws or dismissing successes as luck
rather than skill or dedication.
Taken too far, this perfectionism can also drive endless rumination – an unhealthy
obsession with perfection will reveal flaws in the best plans, and Constant Improvers
often feel forced to abandon a course of action because something doesn’t line up
right. Whether working feverishly or picking at the threads of an idea though,
Constant Improvers can be intense about their goals, and progress towards internal
balance can lead them to amazing personal accomplishments.
Alongside their personal efforts, these personality types also care a great deal what
others think of them. This can be very useful, but they can take this to a fault: fixating
on others’ expectations can sour social efforts into awkwardness. Constant
Improvers are easily thrown off-balance by conflict, and may communicate timidly,
or not at all, for fear of hurting people’s feelings, provoking a confrontation, or
looking the fool.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

35

The Puzzle of Personality

Sometimes it takes peer approval and active encouragement for this Strategy group
to recognize their own virtues. These personalities often benefit from friends and
colleagues patient enough to get to know them and who give them a chance to speak
their minds. When treated considerately, these types become devoted partners and
begin to reveal their kindness, insights, heartfelt support, and the complexities of
their approach to the world, from sometimes (oddly specific) plans for obscure
situations to starry-eyed ambitions.

Social Engagement
Shared traits: Extraverted and Turbulent
Those with the Social Engagement Strategy are an interesting group. In some ways,
Extraversion and Turbulence conflict with each other: Extraversion leads to risktolerance and boldness; Turbulence reflects self-doubt and sensitivity. Turbulence
also contributes to impulsivity, which Extraversion makes highly visible. This means
Social Engagers tend to do what comes naturally first and think about it later. In this
way, they are almost an exaggeration of their underlying personality types. This isn’t
a bad thing.
Social Engagers enthusiastically engage the external world, not content to live in their
minds, drawing emotional security from positive interactions. In business and among
loved ones, these types are usually the center of attention. Social Engagers meet the
needs of the crowd in social settings, but they sometimes hide their true selves to
impress other people. They appreciate social status, and often portray themselves
as the person they aspire to – usually a purer form of their personality type – in order
to achieve it.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

36

The Puzzle of Personality

Social Engagers often experience stunning highs and lows as their Extraversion
pushes their Turbulent need for success into overdrive and their Turbulence creates
an immediate sense of regret, warranted or not. These personality types can be
surprisingly competitive, measuring themselves against peers and hoping others
notice their accomplishments, then retreat, suddenly becoming averse to conflict,
leading them to apologize for or avoid confrontations – even those that ended in
beneficial discussions.
These personalities may falter occasionally in their self-confidence, but ultimately
they are driven to improve and achieve. At the end of the day, they have no trouble
blowing off some steam and enjoying a much-needed break, either. Social Engagers
enthusiastically pursue stimulating and exciting experiences, especially with a group
of friends. They much prefer to dive into an experience than to sit down for a
reserved evaluation, though many will naturally regret their hot-headed lack of
planning down the road.
This push and pull between ambition and alarm, impulse and caution, highs and lows
can itself be quite stressful, but it’s all part of this Strategy’s charm. These personality
types are often restless in pursuit of their goals to improve their circumstances, but
show their passion by indulging their desires through some earned fun (and maybe
shopping for something impressive). Social Engagers work hard at their personal and
professional development, striving to meet all manner of stringent standards, but
they lead dynamic lives as well, filled with companionship, sharing adventures and
accomplishments with others whenever possible. Whatever direction they pull, they
are sure to pull the crowd with them.
While the Strategies are important, this series of e-books simply doesn’t have the
space to explore them properly. For now, we’ll focus on the inner core: The four Roles.

Who Is “The Mediator”?

The Mediator personality is one of the kindest, most sensitive, and curious types.
Fewer than 5% of Americans are believed to be Mediators – averaging 4% among
men and 5%–6% among women. These percentages seem to vary across regions; for
instance, Asian countries tend to have higher percentages of Introverted types, and
locations like Hong Kong and Singapore have a higher number of Intuitive
individuals. Furthermore, Mediators are well-represented in the virtual world, where
they can express themselves freely and test social norms while keeping the stress of
peer pressure at a distance.
Throughout this book, we will discuss how Mediators’ traits manifest themselves into
a complete and unique personality type. Every personality type has probable
behaviors that affect their lives, and we’ll look at each in terms of the following
categories: personal growth, romantic relationships, friendships, parenting, and
academic and professional development. We’ll present a brief overview of the
Mediator personality type, and then we’ll explore each subtopic in much greater
detail.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

39

The Puzzle of Personality

Personal Growth
Introversion may make Mediators seem reserved or shy, but such an exterior can be
deceptive, hiding boundless curiosity and creativity. Although these individuals can
be cautious in public arenas, their inner desire to explore new things shines through
in other aspects of their lives. This seeking nature helps many Mediators evolve
beyond social insecurity, with time and experience. People with this personality type
are deeply sensitive and caring, and they express those qualities with quiet empathy
– positive human contact nourishes their souls and builds their confidence. They
have open minds and hearts, always willing to entertain new perspectives that
expand their own ideas.
For Mediators, personal growth is largely about moving from creative thought into
action –following through to turn their many beautiful hopes, dreams, and ideas into
reality. They have little trouble imagining grand things, and as they grow and mature,
they learn to balance their imagination with perseverance, and can effectively
develop themselves to achieve what matters most to them. Although their natural
attitude is often one of exploration and adaptation, they can learn to deliberately
craft circumstances to suit their will and desires – it takes practice, but it’s a skill with
long-term payoffs in every aspect of life. When Mediators learn to translate their
mental energy into focused practices, their creativity becomes unstoppable.
Friends, Family, and Relationships
Mediators are tireless in their desire to create harmony through understanding, and
they gently elevate their friends, family, and intimate partners in beautiful, subtle
ways. Deeply compassionate, people with this personality type give of their energies
freely, opening themselves fully to those they love and treating close friends like

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

40

The Puzzle of Personality

family. When they have families of their own, Mediators are a sincere well of support
and love, minimally judgmental and very open-minded. Unfortunately, their
emotionally giving nature can leave these types feeling neglected themselves, as few
people ever understand them the way they can understand others. Mediators think
nothing of extending their hearts to others, yet many times, they don’t feel
comfortable asking for the same care they so readily give.
The same hope and sensitivity that make Mediators truly exceptional also make them
a bit vulnerable. They can be hurt easily by unkind or dishonest people, and although
this doesn’t necessarily damage their personal ideals, it can drive Mediators to
temporarily lose their bright outlook, depressing their energy and thoughts. Maturity
and experience help Mediators develop tools to deal with a rough world, insensitive
people, and risky situations, but it can occasionally be difficult to maintain their
balance as they learn.
Fortunately, Mediators have a wonderfully enduring sense of hope that keeps them
going and looking up, even when the world lets them down. They have a marvelous
ability to find inspiration in new things, and though this can occasionally distract
them from responsibilities, it also gives them the resilience to continue to see
potential around every corner and in everyone they meet.
To Mediators, authenticity, understanding, and harmony are often more important
than materialistic rewards. They aren’t afraid to chase the things they truly believe
in, and finding deep, rewarding human relationships is one of their consistent goals.
Academic and Professional Development
Mediators tend to be highly idealistic, feeling disappointed by injustice, ignorance,
and intolerance in the world – and they can apply this view in the workplace and the

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

classroom. They love to discover truth, and often study many diverse subjects and
possibly try many different jobs before finding their true calling. People with this
personality type usually see things with a questioning, hopeful perspective rather
than pure logic, and they try to achieve academic and professional goals through that
open-minded lens. They respond to creativity, morality, and kindness more than
utility or tradition, always seeking to uncover something grander than the mundane.
Mediators often forgo pragmatism in favor of idealism, which can make them highly
innovative in school and on the job. This style may conflict with some types, yet
inspire others.
Luckily, Mediators often excel at sharing their perspective through their speech and
written communication, with distinctively humanistic, warm language that expresses
their hearts, minds, and ideas. They have a talent for creating and interpreting
symbolism, and their rich imaginations often make them seem supernaturally
inspired – few other personality types use metaphors with such finesse. Mediators
connect with others through ideas, and their heartfelt communication style can help
them overcome barriers and move forward in professional and academic
environments alike.
Good communication also allows Mediators to seek knowledge, though they don’t
feel limited by the rules of logical examination. In their opinion, simple facts aren’t
always the fullest form of truth, especially if they disregard human complexity and
need. They’re curious learners and often avid readers, and although they love to
discuss inspired plans and ideas with others, they aren’t fond of debates, preferring
to learn through genuine personal connections rather than intellectual sparring.
They seek mutual understanding with their peers rather than competition – sharing
more than showing off.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

42

The Puzzle of Personality

People with this personality type are sensitive and vulnerable to conflicts, and even
the most calmly confident Mediators tend to take criticism personally. This is one of
their weaknesses, especially in diverse social environments such as work or school
where they often encounter starkly contrasting views. If they cannot escape a
conflict, they may experience unbalanced emotions, and even irritable, irrational
behavior. When battered by social stress in the workplace or classroom, Mediators
may simply retreat from the world, getting lost in their own deep thoughts. At times,
colleagues or peers may need to try to energize and “awaken” Mediators with
positive, gentle opportunities to connect to help these sensitive individuals restore
their balance and move forward.
On That Note …
This introduction has provided only a brief outline of Mediators’ potential strengths
and weaknesses. In the following chapters, we will discuss these areas in much
greater detail and provide suggestions for improvement. Understanding one’s
personality type is incredibly valuable, and the following information can prove
useful to advance Mediators in all areas of their lives.

Personal Growth

Personal Growth

Few other types are as mysterious as Mediators. Calm on the outside but brimming
with passion on the inside, people with this personality type effortlessly blend
earnestness, caution, and a certain airy wisdom. Always seeking peace and
understanding, the dreams of harmony and the influence of empathy that make
Mediators exceptional also can make them vulnerable and sensitive. Maturity and
personal growth are essential pursuits for Mediators, and few people are more eager
to deepen their understanding of themselves.
The most important goals for Mediators are achieving a sense of identity and finding
a comfortable and productive balance between their emotions and their intellect.
These dreamers strive to find the answers to questions such as, “Who am I?” “What
is my purpose?” and “How can I make this world a better place?” However, these
questions, as well as Mediators’ tendency toward constant inner reflection, can
produce more questions than answers and more insight than action.
In a way, personal growth means becoming a hero and fulfilling a hero’s quest in
one’s own life. Everyone has an image of what their lives should be, and growth is

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Personal Growth

about finding a path to fulfillment while overcoming obstacles that get in the way.
For Mediators, it means, at least partly, opening their excessively inward natures
while remaining introspective enough to gain insights that help them craft their
vision for making their world a gentler place.
The Mediator motto might well be: “I thrive to serve, and I serve to thrive.” But that
can’t be done from within a tightly cloistered existence. This is their challenge: to step
beyond mere dreams of good intentions and turn them into reality.
Mediators’ emotions can be a positive force. Unchecked, tumultuous emotions can
leave people feeling lost and confused, and without a steady foundation, they may
feel perpetually shaken. Mediators develop personally when they learn to balance
their emotions and their fertile imaginations with more objectively founded, larger
truths.

Facets of Personal Growth
As part of a comprehensive view of personal growth for Mediators, we’ve separated
the necessary components down into distinct facets. The first three facets of
personal growth are motivational, and fulfilling them helps Mediators identify a more
satisfying life. The latter two are more tactical, and require a more proactive
approach. When questioning the role personal growth plays in a Mediator’s life, the
first three facets are more likely to answer “Why?”, while the final two focus more on
“How?”
The following reflective qualities hinge on self-awareness, an essential source of
motivation for Mediators. In order be happy, productive, and fulfilled, they must
nurture these facets.

•

Self-esteem speaks to Mediators’ sense of their worth.

•

Self-respect speaks to how much they like themselves.

•

Self-confidence is where Mediators find the energy that moves them forward
in life.

The following developmental strategies speak to the more active aspects of personal
growth. Attending to the first three facets of personal growth often facilitates further
development through these facets.
•

Self-evolution describes a path of development that Mediators must follow
to more fully reach their potential.

•

Self-responsibility is Mediators’ ability to take charge of their decisions and
accept the consequences for doing so.

Much of Mediators’ rationale for their thoughts, attitudes, and actions comes from
trying to satisfy these needs and successfully meet their potential. An imbalance in
any of the five facets, and particularly the first three, can become a source of
overwhelming difficulty.
Mediators gain energy and personal power from discovering deep truths about
themselves. Those who feel they fall short on self-esteem, self-respect, or selfconfidence may turn to endless rumination in search of self-discovery, forgetting that
many of those truths arise from engaging other people and living in the material
world. Personal reflection is a strength, but when Mediators immerse themselves too
much in introspection, problems occur.
In the following sections, we’ll first explore balanced Mediators, who successfully use
their strengths and adjust for their weaknesses while satisfying the three reflective
qualities and employing self-evolution and self-responsibility. Then we’ll consider

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

46

Personal Growth

some possible challenges Mediators can face should they decide they aren’t meeting
their potential or engaging properly with their core personalities – in other words, if
they become unbalanced.
Imbalance often occurs when individuals lose their sense of self-esteem, self-respect,
or self-confidence, and it can lead Mediators to either inflate the importance of a
characteristic or underutilize a strength. It can also involve not fully understanding
the course they need to take to lead a more satisfying life. Such situations can be the
product of conscious choices they make or subconscious impulses – so, finally, we’ll
suggest activities to start Mediators on the path to restoring balance.

Self-Esteem
Mediators get their self-esteem – their sense of worth – from their belief in their
beliefs. They revere their beliefs and find a purpose in holding onto them. To them,
their inner world is real, and nurturing it is important.

Balanced Self-Esteem
The Quality of Inspiration
On the surface, Mediators appear mild and temperate, and in many ways, they are –
which leads many people to underestimate the passion of Mediators. Within these
gentle souls, their dedication to justice, peace, and equality churn like a storm. The
self-worth of these types comes from a powerful sense of connection to these
thoughts, and they often wonder why the rest of the world doesn’t feel the same.
Mediators believe the planet would be a better place if others were more
introspective. To people with this personality type, deep insights gained through self-

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

47

Personal Growth

exploration are a precious commodity –the more they feel they possess these deep
insights, the more worth they see in themselves.
Mediators serve meaning on a platter, first to themselves, and then, less so, to others
– not as a matter of selfishness, but as a product of their sensitivity. This tendency
leaves them guarded and private. Given the cultural bias in favor of the Extraverted,
some may believe this means that Mediators offer little to the world, yet their insular,
dreamy natures foster independent thought and being. When they share their
perspectives, they often strike others as quite unique and creative – it’s no accident
these types find their worth in their rich inner musings.
Mediators may boost their own self-esteem by contributing to a cause or even joining
a movement, but they’re less social warriors than philosophers and visionaries with
lessons to share, preferably in emotionally safe and inviting settings. They often work
in helping or teaching professions, where they can more readily use their empathy and share
their insights to small groups or individuals. They’re likely to listen intently and internalize what
others say: Sometimes, these types fulfill their purpose best with silence. Listening and
understanding are enough to give them meaning. They’re the people in the workplace who lend
support to others, which may be more emotional than practical. Nonetheless, they provide an
attentive ear or a shoulder to cry on. Mediators regard positive human connection as an
affirmation of their own value, so they seek out ways to be attentive and encouraging in their
quiet way.
Belief Without Dogma
Beyond their insight and idealism, Mediators have open minds and nonjudgmental
attitudes when they have everything in perspective. Their ideals and beliefs are
essential to their self-esteem, and they would never rob others of their beliefs and
ideals, however drastically they may differ from their own.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

48

Personal Growth

In true Mediator form, they often support the rights of others to live and believe as
they wish just as passionately as they would defend their own choices. If they break
the Mediator mold and follow an activist's lifestyle, they may become involved in
organizations that support the rights of others to live as they choose. Because most
prefer individual connections outside organized causes, their tolerance is most
obvious in their daily lives. For them, affording others the same freedom of thought
and behavior they enjoy themselves is an encouraging act. Doing so allows Mediators
to feel as though they have contributed to an individual’s or a culture’s quality of life.

Unbalanced Self-Esteem
Things go off-kilter with self-esteem when Mediators are too protective of that which
gives them a sense of worth, or when they feel they must prove to themselves (and
perhaps others) that they’re open-minded and supportive people. Either way, they
may act in maladaptive ways to guard their self-esteem against assault.
When Connections Hurt
Mediators often hide their sensitivity. Those who aren’t close to them may never see
how easily people of this type can be hurt. They may even trick themselves into
believing they aren’t as sensitive as they are. Mediators who haven’t acknowledged
and understood their sensitivities may experience a veiled undercurrent of reactivity
that affects everything in their lives.
People with this personality type are protective of the qualities that make them
unique. Because their worth is bundled with their ideas and ponderings, when those
ideas are dismissed or attacked, they take it personally, and tend to nestle deeper
into the safety of their inner lives. Consequently, Mediators are slow to share any of
their inspired thoughts, and slow to let all but the most trusted people into their lives.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

49

Personal Growth

Mediators who haven’t yet gained perspective on their sensitivity often detest conflict
and criticism. No matter how objective or impersonal, criticism may strike these
types as a misreading of their good intentions. Mediators who are already
questioning their self-worth may be especially fragile in such instances: Because of
their sensitivity, they may interpret the flaws others observe as an undermining of
their whole purpose. For example, if a Mediator handed in a report with one section
missing crucial data, they might feel like the error renders the entire report flawed
and worthless. Mediators should avoid overgeneralizing when it comes to criticism.
Tolerance Becoming a Lack of Conviction
Mediators who keep a balanced perspective temper their open-mindedness and
tolerance with an appreciation for the “big picture.” They aren’t likely to tolerate, for
example, an extreme hate group: Realizing the pervasive damage such a group could
potentially inflict on society, Mediators are likely to reject them or criticize them.
However, when they lack the big picture, or when they cannot adequately respond
for whatever reason, they may overcompensate, relying on a strength – in this case,
tolerance – until it becomes a weakness. When an incident or event exceeds what
they can tolerate, instead of passionate outrage, their reaction may be no more than
an utterance: “Oh, my.” These may find themselves allowing for behaviors that, from
a more objective and balanced place, would feel inappropriate to them.
Mediators trying to restore a flagging sense of self-esteem may become so tolerant
that they lose critical judgment in favor of an “everything goes” attitude. They so
desperately want acceptance that they no longer allow negative possibilities to
inform their opinions, or they miss critical specifics that could alter their reactions or
opinions. Mediators typically don’t allow harm, so they’re likely to find their own
stances confusing or contradictory at times. But they won’t find much help for their

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

50

Personal Growth

self-esteem in holding ill-chosen positions. Others may confuse such exaggerated
Mediator acceptance with apathy about people doing harm to themselves or others.

Rebalancing Self-Esteem
All Mediators can benefit from tempering their emotions and instincts with a dose of
rationality. As these types mature, they learn to manage their emotional instincts and
judge criticism more objectively. This gives them greater emotional stability.
Nevertheless, it isn’t an easy approach, as they largely allow their feelings to inform
their decisions and actions.
Objectivity can help Mediators when they fear that criticism is eroding their sense of
worth – their insights and opinions. They often need a perspective that allows them
to see that criticism is often limited in its meaning and scope. Healthy Mediators
recognized that criticism may not be personal, and even if it is personal, it may not
be meaningful: Critics sometimes harbor agendas that are at best unhelpful and at
worst detrimental to the growth and progress of others. Learning to objectively
assess criticism, while recognizing their sensitivities’ influence on their reactions, can
help Mediators handle critical comments more effectively. Once they banish the
assumption that criticism inherently denounces their very being, they can then deal
with feedback in a more constructive, less defensive manner.
Being too sensitive to criticism or conflict is often the product of Mediators indulging
in assumptions. This is likely to occur if they elevate transitory emotions above their
stable, long-term convictions or the reality of their environment. These types aren’t
alone in assuming more than they can prove, but it can create unique problems for
them. One way for them to avoid toppling the tower of self-esteem is to fortify the
foundation. One way to fortify self-esteem is with a game of “Test the Assumption”:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

51

Personal Growth

•

Write down a few assumptions you have: about your life, your work, your
friends, your family...

•

Every day you want to play the game, choose one assumption as the
“Assumption of the Day.” For that day, you are focused on this assumption.

•

Look for a way to test the assumption. In many cases, the best way is simply
asking the right people the right questions.
o For example, if the assumption is that a report is without any merit
simply because a manager criticized one of the graphs, ask the manager
to clarify what the criticism meant.

•

Was your assumption correct? Great! You understand the world a little better
than you might have thought.

•

Was your assumption wrong? Great! You know with certainty that you had
wrongly assumed, and now you can change that assumption.

Make it a point to spot assumptions throughout the day, and test them as soon as
possible. Even if they’re hard to find, accept the challenge to look for them. Keep it
on a game level and have a little fun.
Open-Minded, Yet Discerning
Mediators know well that not everything in life is good or worth supporting.
Nonetheless, should they decide they need to prove their value by showing how
strong their empathy is, they may fail to judge when judging is desirable. This can
eventually backfire because they define their worth by compassionate connection to
others, and an “anything goes” attitude counters that impulse in the long run. There
is a difference between using judgment and being judgmental.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

52

Personal Growth

Shoring up their values and their sense of mission, no matter how often they change,
is the best way to keep Mediators on track and judging wisely. The following exercise
is one way to organize internal thoughts and ideas so that they can inform Mediators’
outer actions and opinions in a consistent manner.
•

Write three statements which quintessentially describe deeply-held values.
You can write physical notes on post-its or notecards, or use a digital notekeeping method

•

Post these value notes somewhere that you’ll see them a lot: around the
house, at the office, in your car. If you’re keeping track digitally, add these
notes to your phone or desktop background, or any other place you can’t miss
them.

•

Throughout the day, consider these three values and how you apply them, if
at all.
o If they aren’t being applied, consider ways to act on them. Consider
discussing the subject with a close friend.

•

After one week of posting up your values, consider all three statements. It isn’t
unusual to discover that some values come from external sources, and aren’t
values you genuinely embrace. Acknowledging this, and adjusting accordingly,
is simply another form of growth. Revise any inconsistent values, and continue
as desired.

Mediators’ positive self-esteem comes from the sense they understand others in a
significant and constructive way. Built into this are tolerance and a need to support
the growth and well-being of others without judging or forcing them to walk a specific
path. When Mediators’ self-esteem serves them well, those qualities shine in their
pure form without any defensive or hidden motives.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

53

Personal Growth

Self-Respect
People who have positive self-respect are, simply, people who like themselves. When
self-respect is strong, they have no fear of looking in their mental mirrors because
they like what they see. People who like themselves are obviously happier and more
satisfied with their lives. Beyond that, they’re likely to care for themselves better and
make better choices. People do more for those they like, and therefore treat them
better. The same principle applies to liking oneself.

Balanced Self-Respect
Mediators respect themselves most when they believe they help victims of evil and
injustice, especially when they simultaneously discover more about themselves. They
want to see themselves as a humane force in the world, but not necessarily through
big acts – just big ideas. Doing good may be personal or global, and their altruistic
efforts can be as simple as boosting a single child’s self-esteem or as ambitious as
working to solve world hunger. These heroes are likely to be more inspirational than
hands-on, and they benefit from others organizing the rescue while they gently
provide the emotional and motivational support.
To the (Emotional) Rescue
Concern for others consumes Mediators, and they dream of ways they can help make
the world a better place. They value integrity above all else. They have little patience
for political movements or agendas, preferring to find individual ways to make a
difference and support others. Making sure that those around them feel
comfortable, providing them a shoulder to cry on, listening attentively to their
concerns – these are just some of the ways that Mediators show respect to others.
They feel they’re at their best when they help people they care about gain insight and

Personal Growth

a richer understanding of themselves. As a bonus, they end up liking themselves as
well.
Embracing Something Bigger
The blocks that build Mediators’ self-respect are more than simple good deeds. They
live in a world of ideas and theories, and their notions always have a central human
element. Their emotions sway their understanding, as if they possess a kind of ethical
DNA that influences their attitudes and outcomes. Although their code may evolve,
Mediators do good for others based on more high-minded purposes than simple,
practical need.
People with this personality type remind the world to think beyond petty and selfcentered concerns. They may not be on street corners shouting about the ways
humankind should live, but quietly, and in everyday ways, Mediators live with an eye
toward moral standards. This doesn’t mean their actions always align with their
ideals; nobody is perfect. However, when they take the moral high ground – mostly
in their thoughts and occasionally in the things they do – Mediators can look at
themselves with respect.

Unbalanced Self-Respect
Unfulfilled Idealism
Mediators’ extreme idealism, paired with their occasional journeys deep into their
own imaginations, can lead to impossible expectations. They often care so much
about an idea that they struggle to accept the reality that its execution may not be
perfect. A winnowing process is required to separate a good idea or two from the
many others that can end up creating an overwhelming flood of unfulfilled

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

55

Personal Growth

intentions. If Mediators need to realize their ideals fully before they can like
themselves, they’ll always suffer from poor self-respect.
Should they attempt to bring about the ideal by doing good works, perfectionistic
Mediators are likely to notice only the aspects that are “not quite perfect.” It becomes
obvious they can’t do good to the degree their idealism demands, potentially
resulting in frustration and surrender to a deep sense of failure and ineffectiveness.
Talking Down to Themselves
Some Mediators have trouble creating or preserving positive self-respect because
their intentions often go unrealized. They sincerely want to help improve the lives of
others, and they have strong convictions about how that should happen. But they
don’t always have the focus needed to pull together a working plan. If their inability
to turn a constellation of emotions into effective actions becomes too troubling, their
self-talk may hone in on their own perceived hypocrisies and failures.
In such instances, Mediators may take a more dogmatic approach to the causes they
value, trying to convince themselves and others of their fervent belief in helping
people. Such uncharacteristically passionate displays can overshadow the
observable fact that they aren’t acting on their convictions. If their goals and
intentions are stated loudly and persistently enough, everyone might forget the
sparseness of the results – or so unbalanced Mediators may believe, for a time.

Rebalancing Self-Respect
Setting Realistic Goals
Idealism can be noble, but when taken too far, it masks reality. Mediators are among
the most idealistic personality types, apt to rely on their hearts instead of their heads

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

56

Personal Growth

when making decisions. Their imaginations are so fertile and filled with principles
that organizing them into action – and even finding a place to begin – can be a
challenge.
Being rational isn’t the same as being heartless, however, and injecting pragmatism
into a plan doesn’t have to water down compassion. Mediators may see rationality
and compassion as incompatible entities. This is a false dichotomy; in fact, being
sensible is necessary to making a difference in the world. Filtering principles, beliefs,
and visions through rationality while still honoring their emotional decision-making
preference allows these types to create goals that lead to more intentional results.
Although they aren’t naturally goal-oriented, Mediators may need to work toward
goals to know whether they’re being effective. Good planning takes concepts beyond
dreams and visions and turns them into action. Some research has found a
correlation between individuals with anxiety and depression and people whose goals
are vague. While this is by no means the case for all Mediators, it suggests that, with
crisp and concrete goals, these types may feel better about themselves.
Here are some steps to facilitate specific goal-setting:
•

Decide on a goal, and create a short list of statements. Avoid words such as
“feeling” and “being.” Use measurable action words, such as “provide,” “build,”
“promote,” “expand,” “develop,” “deliver,” and “streamline.” Make these
statements so precise that the physical movement fills the mind’s eye.

•

Use numbers to define success. For example, “Expand the food bank’s
program to distribute 300 lunches to the homeless around town every
Saturday.”

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

57

Personal Growth

•

Consider whether the goal, as established, is achievable. This entails knowing
deeper information about the absolute statements and numbers you’ve
already set.
o In the above example, this means asking, “Can we gather the
ingredients, assemble the lunches, and find 300 people to feed on a
Saturday afternoon? Will we have enough food, enough workers, and
enough clients to make this a viable venture?” Approached in this
manner, the achievement of the goal is quantifiable.
Overcoming Negativity

When they’re overwhelmed by their idealistic and perfectionistic tendencies,
Mediators may find themselves resorting to negativity, becoming judgmental, and
even isolating themselves – a dangerous habit for this sensitive personality type. As
their self-respect comes from helping others find their potential, vision, and
happiness, they’re unlikely to satisfy it if they isolate themselves either physically or
emotionally.
Once these types realize they can accept or even celebrate their imperfections,
they’re likely to ease up on themselves, and they can begin to appreciate things about
themselves they’d never noticed or had even seen as flaws. A sense of humor can
help a lot with this.
Here are some steps to begin a journey to a more positive sense of self – normal,
human blemishes and all:
•

Choose an activity that is challenging but not overwhelming, such as
participating in a sport or artistic activity, or doing a small home repair. (Pay

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

58

Personal Growth

attention to all safety issues, and keep in mind that a good challenge is difficult
but not impossible.)
•

Engage in the activity knowing that good enough is sometimes good enough.

•

When finished, assess the activity. Was it perfect? Even if it wasn’t, was it a
worthy effort? Celebrate the flaws with a good laugh.

•

Ponder what the exercise says about being perfect.

When Mediators have a negative perspective, it’s often the result of unrealistic
expectations and an inability to fulfill their imagined ideals. For these types,
embracing optimism can seem overwhelming, especially during difficult times, and
yet the easiest way is to counter perfectionism with forgiveness – the same
forgiveness Mediators find give so easily to others.

Self-Confidence
Self-confidence reflects the energy channeled when individuals trust in their
thoughts, feelings, and abilities. The greater the self-confidence, the more energy
goes into moving forward in life. Although many elements influence how confidently
people live, members of each personality type have distinctive traits that affect their
self-confidence levels.

Balanced Self-Confidence
Who They Hope to Be
Mediators get their confidence from feeling connected to their own identity and
aspirations. Anything these types regard as phony disappoints them; Mediators they
try to be as “real” as possible, and masks, lies, and insincerity cause them great
uneasiness and disappointment. However, living according to their ideals can be a
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

59

Personal Growth

tall order. Their rich imagination always entertains thoughts of how the world, and
all its inhabitants, should operate.
Going through life with such aims can provide Mediators with an optimistic outlook
they can use to encourage themselves and others to be better people. When
Mediators lend an ear to others, as they often do, they advise with a sense of selfassurance because their advice is heartfelt and feels honest. Grounded Mediators
find confidence not so much in what they do, but in what they dream. Whenever they
can connect even a part of such dreams to the world around them, it bolsters their
confidence and helps them move forward with a sense of purpose.
Maintaining Confidence in a Material World
Although they’re focused inward, Mediators still live in the physical world and must
find enough confidence to persevere in that realm. When motivated, they adopt
positive characteristics that bring sufficient measure of outward success or, at the
very least, survival. (After all, even these gentle dreamers cannot dream up their next
meal, so they must attend to the practical business of living.) Even when adapting to
the outer world, Mediators never wander far from their imaginative inner lives.
Those seeking guidance are unlikely to spend much time leafing through self-help
books, which they tend to see as superficial and mercenary. These types more often
seek help in psychology, philosophy, religion, or “New Age” texts – disciplines that
speak to their hearts as well as minds, and ground them in their unique way.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

60

Personal Growth

Unbalanced Self-Confidence
Honestly Inflexible
Mediators in a crisis of confidence may overcompensate by pushing their own
agendas. Insecure people are often the loudest voices in the room. These types are
usually very subdued, gentle people, and rarely the loudest voice, but if intent on
restoring their confidence they can abandon their characteristic open-mindedness
to serve themselves. Although rigidity and dogmatic behavior is clearly atypical for them,
these are natural reactions for Mediators who doubt their connection to their core selves and
feel compelled to reinforce it.
This tendency will backfire as Mediators impede the growth and well-being of others
– and their own – with their new behaviors. To re-align themselves with their
principles, they may, paradoxically, lose sight of one of their overarching values:
protecting the welfare of others. Being true to themselves doesn’t necessarily entail
centering their own preferences, but Mediators who doubt themselves and try to
artificially inflate their confidence risk making this very mistake.
Deep Introspection
Those who are unsure of themselves may look even further inward than usual, in
search of further clues to their own identities and ways to fit that identity into their
lives. This misses a crucial fact: people sometimes learn more about themselves by
their responses to other people, and by other people’s response to them. Although
letting others define them certainly isn’t the standard path to personal growth for
Mediators, navel-gazing isolation brought about by insecurity may rob them of an
opportunity for more comprehensive self-discovery. These types can learn a lot
about themselves from other people, if they take the chance.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

61

Personal Growth

Mediators who cloister themselves to protect their true natures might well preserve
a sense of integrity: A trip outside the metaphorical walls of their own isolation may
allow other peoples to challenge, criticize, and perhaps even painfully reject them for
simply being who they are. For rare, Introverted types, isolation can be tempting.
However, too much time worrying about what is “real” and “genuine” about
themselves may, against their intentions, siphon away energy from expressing their
realness and genuineness. Instead of securing their self-confidence as intended, too
much inward focus can erode it. For real confidence, Mediators may need to break
free of introspection long enough to practice what they ponder.

Rebalancing Self-Confidence
Restoring Open-Minded Confidence
True confidence allows people to act with the right measure of assuredness. Too little
confidence means no energy. But Mediators artificially inflating confidence by
stubbornly insisting that their reality is superior to any other isn’t a good option
either. In the end, many Mediators find that lacking energy is easier to contend with
than repelling the people they want to help. Better yet, these types should reconnect
with that which gives them genuine confidence.
One way to rebalance self-confidence involves consciously connecting purpose and
principles to the actions the Mediators take:
•

List your ideals, purposes, and intentions. This list doesn’t have to be complete
or comprehensive, and it should

•

Support other peoples throughout your day in ways that are consistent with
the values on the list. It can be as simple as encouraging a grocery clerk for
carefully bagging groceries.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

62

Personal Growth

•

Keep a tally of the people you’ve supported. Accountability, even to yourself,
promotes a greater level of action.

Mediators develop and preserve self-confidence by approaching life with integrity
and genuineness, such that their lives reflect their values and purpose. The above
exercise can help them review what’s important to them while encouraging outreach
to others in small and large ways. Activities like this one promote connection between
subjective values and objective actions – essential for restoring balance.
Testing Their Truths
To fulfill their identity needs, Mediators must cultivate their inner qualities in
Introverted solitude and express them in the outer world. There is no “either/or” –
both are necessary components for nurturing growth. Should these types find
themselves concealing their genuine selves from the world, they may want to pursue
tests of their identity in safe yet challenging ways. When solitude becomes isolation,
Mediators should make a conscious effort to counteract unhelpful seclusion. An easy
technique for nurturing connectedness is to share a meal:
•

Choose a day within the next month to invite someone to lunch or dinner,
someone who isn’t a regular guest: An old friend or acquaintance, or a
trustworthy person you’ve recently met.

•

Don’t cook? Eat out or order take-out. It’s about the time together, not the
food.

•

Set aside time to

•

Whether it was a satisfying event or not, it was the opposite of isolation. If it
wasn’t satisfying, try another person. If it was, consider a follow-up meeting.

Self-Evolution
Self-evolution is the process of taking a more purposeful role in growth,
understanding oneself better, and learning how to effect change in the world. For
Mediators, this must include finding ways to act. Although they’re often viewed as
merely well-intentioned, people with this personality type can be so much more, and
they’re well-equipped with the imagination needed to breathe life into their dreams
and visions.

Balanced Self-Evolution
Meeting Real Challenges
Mediators are very interested in growth, but self-evolution goes beyond the organic
style of development many of them imagine. Self-evolution is a more deliberate
scheme that allows people with this personality type to transform their lives for the
better. Self-esteem, self-respect, and self-confidence fuel the self-evolution engine.
Self-evolution returns the favor by organizing Mediators’ responses to the three.
When they’re all working together, they create a powerful engine that propels their
life toward fulfillment.
Mediators can take many paths to evolve. They might take a route created by
someone else – maybe following spiritual, philosophical, or religious direction. Or,
they might develop their own growth practices from various other sources and life
experiences. Whatever their process for growth, it likely involves empathy, altruism,
imaginative perspectives, and open-mindedness. Mediators distinguish between
self-help as a utilitarian approach that brings them physical or emotional gains and
self-growth as the natural result of living “correctly.” Generally, if they happen to

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

64

Personal Growth

pursue such practices, they’re likely more aligned with meditation, which raises
awareness, than with self-hypnosis, which pursues goals.
However, genuine growth for Mediators means they have evolved to harness their
dreams and extend them into the real world, translating vision into practice. Evolved
Mediators have met the challenge this task represents, and in so doing they’ve
unlocked their incredible potential.
Growth Without End
Those who successfully advance in their self-evolution are aware of their strengths
and weaknesses, and they develop life goals around them. However, that’s only part
of the story. As with all types, finding and utilizing their strengths alone isn’t sufficient:
Becoming well-rounded and expanding beyond one’s comfort zone are part of the
formula for growth. For Mediators, this means attaching meaningful actions to their
otherwise contemplative lives.
The famous saying, “Life is a journey, not a destination,” rings true for most
Mediators. Self-evolution is a continuing, lifelong course of digging deep into their
beliefs and worldviews. More than most, Mediators see themselves in a state of
perpetual transformation. Between their constantly shifting focus and their
expansive imaginations, everything remains fluid. For them, no milestone along the
way marks the completion of their developmental work because, in their view, they
never finish. That may sound exhausting to some, but not knowing what “finished”
looks like often excites Mediators.

Unbalanced Self-Evolution
Inflated Expectations
One of the difficulties Mediators find with self-evolution is that their ideals are so
utopian that it would be impossible to match them in real life. Excessively high
expectations can become discouraging when trying to make those expectations
happen. To make things more difficult, Mediators’ thoughts resemble a web rather
than a straight line: One notion veers off to three others, which veers off to nine
more. It can be intimidating to untangle all those thoughts into something
resembling a goal. It can be daunting to even find a starting place, much less a
successful conclusion.
The unbalanced response to Mediators’ gloriously tangled webs and lofty ideals is to
treat them as ends in themselves. Trying to sort disparate strands into action plans
often leads to frustration and can eventually result in a loss of confidence. Eventually,
those who haven’t found a way to pull all their thoughts into some reasonable,
organized formation may become discouraged. One of their developmental
challenges involves acting despite their own disorganization and staying hopeful
about progress. For Mediators struggling with this imbalance, negative self-talk is
likely to become the prominent voice in their heads.
A Mesmerizing Path
People with the Mediator personality type not only become fascinated by the ideas
their imaginations create, and experience awe at the wonders of the world around
them. However, indulging their inner poets can entangle Mediators, who may even
confuse their focus on beauty and wonder with genuine growth. The steps needed
for practical development are unlikely to be found in an unending appreciation for

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

66

Personal Growth

abstract ideas and perpetual awe over the beauty of existence. On a practical level,
a dream will never beat a plan.
As Lewis Carroll wrote, “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you
there.” Mesmerized by the intangible and lacking any measurable goals, Mediators
may find themselves on a road to nowhere. Life may start to feel empty for them, as
they, like everyone else, must exist in a material world where the common measure
of success is the practical impact of an individual’s life. Life may be a journey, but if
that journey involves only meandering, then serious questions about purpose are
likely to arise in the minds of the wanderers.

Rebalancing Self-Evolution
Embracing Growth Responsibly
When it comes to Self-Evolution, Mediators need to mind their tendency towards
unrealistic expectations. Even more than this, they may want to address things they
tell themselves that suggest they can’t find a moderate and more practical path to
growth. If they believe they can sort out their web of beliefs and intentions and find a
path that works, they’re more likely to do just that. Fortunately, Mediators’
imaginations, when martialed and organized, are just the tools they need to nurture
positive beliefs that lead to strategies that work well for them.
For Mediators, true growth comes from granting themselves the same compassion
and empathy they give to others. This can include developing self-talk that
encourages progress rather than paralysis. To that end, they can try role-playing. The
following “Be Your Own Best Friend” exercise is well within the scope of their
imaginations:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

67

Personal Growth

•

List the negative things you tell yourself about your life or actions. Try to come
up with five or more.

•

Put two chairs face-to-face.

•

When you sit in one chair, you are simply you. When you sit in the other chair,
you are your own best friend.

•

Sit in “your” chair and describe one of your negatives you wrote down, as if
talking to your best friend.

•

Switch chairs. As “your own best friend,” reassure yourself, as you would any
friend. Explore any negative self-talk from a more compassionate perspective
and search for balance and realistic implications.

•

Do this until you have given yourself a good, positive talking-to about
everything on your list.

•

If this seems silly or awkward, try it alone or with a trusted and willing friend.

Accepting a little help, especially from themselves, can help Mediators balance their
needs and move their ideas forward.
Reconnecting
Human life and growth depend on insights and natural evolution. But the cosmos
expresses life through action, and although it’s impossible for humans to avoid all
exertion of effort, it’s possible to suppress the tendency. Some Mediators, at times,
may avoid taking action by encapsulating themselves in their world of ideas and
beliefs: endlessly searching for meaning means never settling, and without the
stability of definition, the foundation for building is shaky. However, those who selfevolve ask not only, “What I am about?” but also, “What is it I do?”

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

68

Personal Growth

Mediators interested in genuine self-development must break the cycle typical of the
type: rumination punctuated by hypnotic effects of inspirational moments. Selfevolution doesn’t require abandoning the search for insight, or ignoring moments
filled with profound, self-actualizing experiences: it requires harnessing some of that
energy to create something concrete. For these types, finding ways to do so can be a
lifelong challenge, but one worth accepting and well within their abilities.
The following exercise can give Mediators a small taste of transforming a more
emotional response into a concrete action:
•

Find the most beautiful object available in the vicinity.

•

Get a plain piece of paper and a pencil. A regular pencil is fine, but a colored
pencil may make the exercise more interesting.

•

Draw the object, trying to get as close to photographic accuracy as possible.
This is a private exercise, so simply do your best.

•

Should your mind drift toward more symbolic or abstract considerations,
return to thoughts of lines, shadows, and shades. Be a camera more than an
artist.

•

Consider posting the picture or saving it as reminder to view things exactly as
they are, rather than through a subjective filter.

Connecting to physical things can help Mediators balance their rich internal
experience. Much like mindfulness mediation, the only goal is to notice the world as
it is – rather than the way it should be. Mediators who manage such a balance create
a paradigm in which they can enjoy the best of both realms.

Self-Responsibility
Self-responsibility sounds simple, but it can be difficult to practice. People who grasp
a sense of self-responsibility decide matters for themselves, act independently, and
follow interests without being excessively reliant on the opinions or permission of
others.

Balanced Self-Responsibility
Morally Independent
Mediators test responsibility by running relevant issues through their ethical filters –
filters which don’t necessarily align with what society considers moral. Morals are the
product of personal insight for these types, more so than the product of a cultural
code, but the individual nature of their values doesn’t make Mediators any less
beholden to them.
As an example, Mediators are often sympathetic to those whom others may consider
outcasts on moral or religious grounds. On some level, these types may feel a
responsibility to at least ponder issues of fairness for those who are different,
perhaps even staking out a radical position. As people with this type are so rare and
often regarded as almost eccentric, it may be easy for them to identify with such
groups. More importantly, however, their moral decisions come from within rather
than from the masses.
In other words, Mediators’ sense of responsibility is moral and independent in
nature. Although they may benefit from the lessons of teachers and gurus and take
them seriously, they aren’t likely to let their final decisions rest on any teachings. This

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

70

Personal Growth

control from within matches the many other internal aspects of what it means to be
Mediators.

Unbalanced Self-Responsibility
Becoming Helpless
The disconnect some Mediators experience between their aspirations and their
accomplishments can feel like constant failure in the face of constant effort. They
may acquire a sense that no matter what they do, they’ll never gain traction, and
eventually they start asking themselves and people around them, “Why bother?”
Because Mediators are so idealistic, their failures may be as innocuous as the
everyday disappointments that come with perfectionism – with such a mentality,
anything less than perfection is inadequate. Such frustrations can strip these types
of their sense of control, leading them to conclude they’re helpless and powerless.
If Mediators believe they have no control and that nothing is effective, they may
conclude there’s no point in trying to do anything. Because of the moral overtones
of their lives and their sensitivity, abdication of responsibility may result in a fullblown moral crisis. They may start to think of themselves as not just helpless people
but as moral failures, and negative self-talk can once again gain a foothold.
Loss of Serenity
People often feel they don’t have control not because it doesn’t exist, but because
they convince themselves it’s absent. Others may lose it because they confuse the
things they can control with the things they can’t. For Mediators, who live so much in
their imaginations, sorting out what is and isn’t their responsibility can be more
difficult because they’re able to create so many varied scenarios in their minds. The

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

dilemma can worsen when they have an abundance of principles and a sense of
responsibility but no practical idea of how to use these assets.

Rebalancing Self-Responsibility
Helpless to Helpful
The best and most obvious way to beat an acquired sense of helplessness is success
– which usually requires clear intentions and an action plan. Intention may come
easily to Mediators, and they can learn to develop clarity and a plan of attack.
Although they can certainly gain planning skills independently, they can also consider
partnering with others who have already developed them, or those who have a
natural knack for getting things done. One of the best ways to learn is by doing, and
such partnerships are likely to encourage participation, which leads to picking up
helpful habits.
The following exercise requires some thought, a little planning, and a measure of
action.
•

Set a two-minute timer. Think of the nicest thing that can be done for a specific
person.

•

Set a 10-minute timer, and list the following things:
o What actions is needed to fulfill the nice thing?
o What resources will be needed, if any?
o By what date and time will the nice thing be done?

•

Follow the dictum, “Plan your work and work your plan.”

•

On completing the plan, celebrate by doing something nice for yourself.

•

Repeat this exercise once a week for a month or more.

Discerning Control
Deciding what they can change and then making concrete, measurable plans to
change it can help Mediators restore their sense of responsibility – but, first things
first. Organize the lush variety of ideas that constitute their consciousness into areas
they can and cannot influence themselves may help them determine, “What am I
responsible for, and what am I not responsible for?”
However, sorting presents Mediators with choices. They may need to let go of things
they cannot control, or allow themselves to go with the flow. Regarding the things
they can control, they may need to determine whether the situation needs
controlling, whether the responsibility belongs to them, and how they should
address their responsibility.
This exercise can help Mediators recognize and reflect upon their level of control:
•

Wear a visually distinct or noticeable item, one you wouldn’t typically wear.
This can be as simple as a rubber band or a piece of string, and as bold or
obvious as you dare.

•

Each time you or someone else takes notice of this accessory, ask yourself as
a reflex, “What do I control in this situation? What is out of my control?”

•

What reaction, if any, did this exercise elicit from other people? Were there any
surprises?

It’s hard to take responsibility without focus. Mediators need to connect to their
values to discover the right motivations, focus on the things they can control, and
then commit to decisive and specific actions. When they manage their goals in this
way, focus is likely to accompany them throughout their efforts.

Conclusion
When you talk about personal growth in Mediators, you can’t get far without some
reference to spirituality. Some define this as a person being part of something bigger
than themselves. For some, this may feel like connecting to some sort of higher
consciousness. Even Mediators without a spiritual practice or religion explore ideas
that are bigger than they are. Such ideas involve their own growth and the growth
and well-being of others, and much of their development depends on responding to
what they discover.
Those who use their strengths while expanding their comfort zones often find that
growth is a balance between staying true to themselves while adapting to the world
around them. By understanding their moral foundations and acting in ways that
honor them, Mediators can create fulfillment and live purposefully. Learning when
to stand resolute, and when to be flexible and open to feedback, helps these types
discover a path toward evolution and development. When they do, they become
heroes in their own lives.
Each Mediator has their own spin on life, having adapted to their unique worlds in
different ways. Some skillfully navigate the process of personal growth, and others
struggle to make any headway, but everyone fluctuates between days filled with
wonderful growth and times that lack such improvement: No one lives the perfect
life of their imagination. Nonetheless, growth and learning are always choices for
those who are willing. Hopefully, we’ve provided some guidance and inspiration to
bolster that willingness.

Romantic Relationships

Seeking a Deep Connection
Mediators are starry-eyed, romantic idealists who often daydream about perfect
relationships abundant in harmony and warmth – a union of souls communicating
their deepest truths and feelings. For these types, looking for partners or nurturing
existing relationships are often essential goals. This idealism is among their most
appealing romantic qualities, even if they sometimes set them up for disappointment
when others can’t match their pure, open-hearted love.
These types offer their partners bright enthusiasm and joy, using their vivid
imaginations to come up with insightful ways to keep their romantic relationships
lively. This is a particularly endearing quality in early dating: the fun never stops with
Mediators. Many of the other personality types thrill at the novelty that Mediators
bring to dates, while others struggle to keep up with brilliance, whimsy, and
spontaneity, especially amidst the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of early dating.
Mediators engage deeply with ideas, beliefs, and dreams, which can challenge
partners of personality types that think mainly in routine and live by a plan. When
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

75

Romantic Relationships

partners don’t share their fondness for the fantastical, abstract dimensions of things,
Mediators may lose interest – they want lovers to at least listen to their imaginings.
Moreover, these types want to share in their partners’ dreams, and to participate
with gentle encouragement and excitement. It’s only natural that they want their
partners to reciprocate.
Embracing Change
Mediators possess a quiet lightness of being, and can be very optimistic and
accepting even in the face of unforeseen events. They appreciate moving into new
experiences. However, their energy can swing like a pendulum: They may be warmly
social with close friends and lovers sometimes, and contemplative and solitary at
other times, with these same people. These types embrace the transitions, and those
who love them face a lot of unexpected changes.
Mediators’ views on romantic relationships may often be poetic, but they’re not
always realistic. Their tendency to idealize their lovers can sometimes create
confusion as both partners react to changing expectations. However, if Mediators
are mature enough to recognize and address these tendencies, they reap great
rewards in their efforts toward personal growth. Even if their imaginations get
carried away now and then, Mediators treat their romantic partners to deep, caring
warmth that transcends many problems.
A Need for Harmony
While they adapt wonderfully to many aspects of love, Mediators’ desire for harmony
with their partners means that they typically avoid criticism and conflict. While this
can contribute to the stability of their relationships, it can also cause subtle problems:
These types may find it hard to speak up for their own interests, often allowing their

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

76

Romantic Relationships

needs to become secondary to those of their lovers. This lack of communication has
the potential to disrupt the balance in a relationship, and it can be a hard habit to
break.
Even when they make their voices heard, Mediators may struggle to receive criticism
or hear contradictory ideas without interpreting them as faults in themselves –
they’re highly sensitive, and may respond with anger or simply feel wounded. They
almost reflexively sublimate themselves in favor of those they love, and while this is
wonderful with romantic partners who are equally caring and perceptive, it’s not
always fair with those less sensitive than they are.
Adapting to Love
While the potential exists for these types to lose touch with their own needs amidst
their devotion to their partners, they also find great joy in adapting to other people’s
unique presence in their lives. Love gives Mediators a chance to experience new
perspectives, and a balanced version of “losing themselves” in their partners can be
magical, as if they enter another world by engaging their partners’ desires. When they
maintain their own perceptions and preferences as well, such discovery together can
be exciting and healthy.
Another wonderful facet of Mediators’ ability to explore and adapt is that they open
the minds of stubborn or tradition-bound partners. Highly empathetic, people with
this personality type aren’t likely to judge their loved ones. However, through gentle
coaxing, they can easily make people think twice about their habits, opening them to
new ideas. Mediators’ imaginative curiosity can be inspiring, and partners immersed
in their own daily routine can find their sweet influence as freeing as a vacation.

Potential Role Pairings
Unique Opportunities
Every personality type brings different things to their romantic relationships, and
knowing a little about what to expect from different Role groups helps Mediators get
to know potential partners and build solid relationships. However, it’s important to
remember that people are unique, regardless of their type, and while a perfect
romance can exist in novels and television shows, the real world is not so perfect.
Any people who fall in love may get along wonderfully and may have a few problems;
in healthy relationships, they’re likely to experience both.
In this section, we lay out guidance on how Mediators and other types can better
understand each other, including some of the more likely areas of conflict between
them. Warm, empathetic, and adaptable, Mediators can truly find balanced love with
any other type, so long as the individuals involved demonstrate qualities that enable
fair and loving connections.
Mediators should consider that the issues raised in the Personal Growth chapter may
relate to their approach to love. Romantic relationships provide good context for selfevolution, and ensure that unproductive or destructive habits aren’t present. Selflove and self-respect build people who are ultimately able to be happier romantic
partners.

Mediator-Analyst Relationships

Love between Mediators and Analysts often grows from the way they balance each
other’s weaknesses and learn from each other’s strengths. Linked by the Intuitive
trait, both types can see the wonderful possibilities that the other brings into their
lives, and find such potential intriguing. Mediators think in terms of human
connection and Analysts in terms of rational processes, and, in each other, these
imaginative lovers find not only a whole new way of thinking, but also new
dimensions of themselves.

Balanced Mediator–Analyst Relationships
Shared Imagination
Mediators’ imagination can provide great ways to get to know Analyst partners. Both
thrive on creative discussions, from sharing ideas about a product they’re developing
to explaining the intricacies of a book they’re writing. Analyst partners find it easy to
keep up with imaginative processes, and delight in assisting with brainstorming on
any front. Complex and abstract ideas enthrall these pairs, and they can spend
endless hours together discussing philosophical topics or coming up with ideas.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

79

Romantic Relationships

Relationships between Mediators and Analysts can be incredibly rewarding, as these
individuals look at things from a different yet somehow familiar perspective. When
Mediators are interested in complex topics, they spend a significant amount of time
not just studying the concrete details, but also contemplating the intangible side of
the topic. Analysts are often impressed by the depth of understanding that Mediators
gain by using their hearts as well as their minds.
Mediators are no less impressed by Analysts’ ability to make decisions through
rational processes. Those who maintain open-mindedness see the value in Analysts’
ability to remain objective, a detachment that Mediators sometimes find personally
challenging. They appreciate Analyst partners who anchor their fantastical take on
life with blunt intellectualism. In turn, their Analyst lovers value Mediators’ ability to
take any imagined subject to the next level.
Discovering New Abilities
Besides sharing complementary imaginations, these couples can be profoundly
helpful to each other’s growth. They can learn a lot from each other in how they
express emotion differently. Analysts have plenty of emotion, but rarely place
emphasis on expressing or understanding their feelings, and may even deride such
efforts, often seeming distant and clumsy with such matters. Mediators are perfectly
suited to helping Analysts understand this side of themselves, providing an example
of being in touch with their feelings.
This learning goes the other way as well. To be frank, Mediators are a type likely to
become lost in emotion, especially during upsetting events. There are many
moments in life where they’d be wise to step back, detach, and think about what’s
happening instead of being swept along by their feelings. The cool-headed example

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

80

Romantic Relationships

of thoughtful Analyst partners helps them practice such skills during moments of
heightened emotion. Having them by their side as an example is a powerful reminder
to Mediators of the self-control they can develop if they choose.
The balance these two can bring each other translates directly into daily life, not just
abstract concepts of growth. Mediators are pulled to share wonderous personal
expressions of creativity with the world, but the logistics of how to successfully do so
may be hard for them to master. Analyst partners can help them fit all the little logical
pieces together to reach those goals. Likewise, Analysts are likely to struggle with
friction in the social world, as they often lack tact and sensitivity. When they bring
their social problems to Mediator partners, they receive invaluable human insights
that enable them to improve their relationships.

Unbalanced Mediator–Analyst Relationships
Silent Damage
Romantic gestures typically send messages of interest, but the differences in how
these two types express themselves can lead to hurt feelings or missed connections.
Unaccustomed as they usually are to an emotional approach, Analysts may not
understand the importance of sweet little romantic steps, or perform them with
forced sincerity as they try and match expectations. Mediators – who read much
depth into even minor actions – are easily disappointed by such half-hearted efforts,
so even gestures that represent sincere interest may seem shallow to them. Initial
connections can be tough when these two types don’t take a balanced,
understanding approach to each other’s different ways of expressing romance.
Analysts invest a lot of effort in deciding their priorities, but intimate emotional
relations are rarely high on their list unless they’re made aware of a need. Even the

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

81

Romantic Relationships

most caring Analysts are unlikely to proffer the kind of lush, emotional interaction
their Mediator lovers crave. Instead, they prioritize what they see as functional
contributions to their romantic relationships. Their practical efforts may not satisfy
Mediators’ need for intimate connection, however, and real problems can occur
when Mediators remain silent about what they really want. Analysts can certainly
learn to meet their partners’ needs, but rarely do so without prompting and steady
guidance. Without it, this deficit can grow intolerable until Mediators explode with
emotion – simply confusing Analysts further.
Out of Sync Priorities
These two types might learn to balance their expressions of emotion, but when
Mediators and Analysts don’t respect each other’s priorities, ongoing and increasing
friction can result. There’s no specific subject where these two always differ: different
criteria for decision-making and different preferences on where they want to put
their energy mean these two can find a lot to disagree about. It’s likely neither type
is wrong, but this may still become a problem when they don’t fairly balance their
right to their own pursuits with their responsibility to mutual needs and concern for
each other’s goals.
Mediators often model their priorities in life around exploring the intangible,
including emotional connections, and they love to share this exploration with their
partners. They may not understand why Analysts don’t share their values, however,
and can easily become hurt and resentful. Analysts focus on systems, tactics, and
rational processes; when they take this perspective too far, they may dismiss
Mediators’ lofty ideas, and consequently miss opportunities to expand their
imaginations.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

82

Romantic Relationships

In romantic relationships, some level of mutual effort toward the common good is
needed. When these types disagree on how to proceed, however, it’s hard to get
anything done. Over time, they may lose their sense of balance, leading them to
resent each other for the time, energy, and money they spend on “unimportant”
things. If they don’t find ways to address life’s everyday responsibilities together,
everything from debt to dirty laundry can start to pile up in their lives.

Rebalancing Mediator–Analyst Relationships
Improving Communication
Working to understand their emotional differences can smooth over potential
conflicts for Mediator–Analyst couples, especially early in their relationships. There’s
little in the way of an adequate substitute for understanding, which takes time and
effort. However, when these partners are respectful and encouraging, this process
brings them closer together. Mediators can help their Analyst lovers to reveal more
of their feelings by setting a positive example of openness, asking them to share, and
being encouraging when they do. Though Analysts may express some cynical
thoughts, discussing feelings together is a huge step toward balance for these
couples. Mediators can also avoid asking for too much, too fast – Analysts have a
right to privacy in their own heads, just like anyone else.
An important step for both types is listening: simply taking in what their partners are
saying without immediate comment. Since Analysts are unlikely to naturally respond
with empathy, this deliberate reflection allows them to develop appropriate
responses that support their partners’ needs and feelings. In turn, Mediators can use
such contemplation to moderate the emotion in their responses. When these
couples practice being emotionally perceptive, they achieve a more complete form

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

83

Romantic Relationships

of intelligence that enhances their relationships. These partners can use the
following to help them navigate this area of personal growth together:
•

Scheduling more in-depth “sharing time” at the end of each week.
o Planning sharing around an unrelated but pleasant activity can make an
uncomfortable talk easier. Consider a fancier-than-normal dinner,
shared bath, or a walk outside – something each person enjoys.

•

Use this time to talk about the highlights of each other’s week, including
emotional difficulties and personal triumphs.

•

Asking about each other’s thoughts and feelings daily, sharing honestly, but
doing so simply – avoiding overloading each other with words, and asking for
emotional support whenever needed.

•

Validate each other’s feelings with the occasional show of approval.

•

Focusing on creating an aura of relaxation and interest.

•

Hold back complaints about each other at another time. Keep this time as a
free space where partners are comfortable and respected.

In balanced relationships, verbal affirmations of understanding and appreciation are
needed from both types of partners. Mediators can take the lead by demonstrating
and encouraging non-judgmental, emotional openness with their Analyst lovers.
Even if one partner chooses not to share everything all the time, they’ll love knowing
that the other is always ready to listen with love.
Accepting Each Other’s Priorities
Mediators and Analysts don’t need to fully understand or agree with each other’s
priorities in life, but in balanced relationships, they do respect and actively support
those distinct pursuits. However, for their lives together to be functional and

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

84

Romantic Relationships

enjoyable, they must also agree on certain realities that affect them daily, such as
household chores, shared bills, and social or work obligations. It’s important that
these couples handle these sorts of priorities before they pour their hearts into more
personal pursuits. Otherwise, they may find their freedom threatened by unfinished,
mounting responsibilities. Cooperation can make quick work of such things: they just
need to sit down, plan, and then act – together.
When Mediator–Analyst couples see their mutual priorities accomplished, they find
it a lot easier to support each other’s personal pursuits. It’s also a wonderful
demonstration of love to participate in things that are important to their significant
others, if they want the company. Directly experiencing each other’s personal
passions goes a long way toward rebalancing differences, and each may find it
unexpectedly interesting.
If Analysts are obsessed with some technology, they’re likely thrilled at the chance to
explain it to Mediators, who in turn may appreciate seeing its inner workings more
clearly, tapping into their natural curiosity. Likewise, Mediators may have personal
hobbies to share that Analysts may find interesting, from art, literature, and music to
their favorite games. Neither type should feel obligated or pressured to spend their
personal time on the other’s interests, but they can benefit greatly by at least trying
them out by:
•

Discussing daily and weekly priorities with each other.

•

Identifying and agree on matters that are of mutual benefit, and sharing the
work.

•

Making things interesting by trying out different, new ideas to see what works
best.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

85

•

Ensuring each partner is free to jump in if they have an inspiration on how to
get it done best, and that the other partner can join in.

•

Completing routine matters before moving on to individual pursuits.

•

Inviting each other into personal pursuits and positively demonstrating their
appeal in front of each other.

•

Devoting some time and energy to supporting each other’s personal projects
and goals, especially if they focus on development and accomplishment.

The core appreciation that Mediators and Analysts feel for each other as individuals
can be a source of motivation to balance their perspectives. Analysts may not care
about painting, and Mediators might find engines boring, but if that’s their partners’
taste, they can cheerfully support them.

Mediator–Diplomat Relationships

Mediators find a good sense of connection with fellow Diplomats, often growing
close with them quickly – which isn’t always easy for these sensitive types. While they
have some notable differences within their Role group, Mediators and other

of both wonderful strengths and a few weaknesses. If they have a fault, it can be

caring too much, and the attendant emotional drama that may sometimes bring. But,
because they connect so well at the heart, Mediators and Diplomats in love have an
unsurpassed capacity to sustain each other for a lifetime.

Balanced Mediator–Diplomat Relationships
Emotional Resonance
Thanks to their similar emotional filters for viewing life, harmony develops
organically between these types, with partners expressing their thoughts and
feelings in open and empathetic ways. While this dynamic doesn’t always contribute
to objective thought, these lovers do become deeply attuned to each other’s desires
and needs, and are usually quite enthusiastic about making each other happy. When
such people feel each other’s emotions so strongly, it’s only natural that they want to
share as much joy together as possible.
In relationships with Diplomats, Mediators may feel that someone finally
understands them – their strong emotional connection acts as a foundation to
enable other forms of communication. These partners can share ideas, opinions, and
problems together, counting on this underlying bond to help them navigate their
differences and difficulties. Sensitive, emotional people may indeed be prone to
some fiery fights, but when real love is present, they can make it up to each other
and be stronger for it. Despite perfectly normal rocky spots now and then, Mediator–
Diplomat couples who invest in long-term relationships find they become essential
parts of each other’s happiness.

A Pair of Dreamers
The resonant bonds these couples form can support more than just their happiness
when they’re together – it also strengthens them as individuals following their own
paths. People of similar (or even identical) personality types might have different
interests, passions, and life goals, but something Mediators and Diplomats do share
is highly active imaginations. These two find their collaborative ideas marvelous, and
while they might not share equal interest in everything, they become fans and
supporters of each other’s dreams.
This is a personality type that often struggles to act, even when they’re inspired, so
having a supportive partner is an excellent way for Mediators to realize their own
goals. Sometimes the push they need to move themselves forward comes from a
Diplomat partner contributing their happy energy. These types might even end up
sharing some goals as a couple, and when they complement their dreaming with a
dose of effort, they become partners in achievement as well as love. Whether it’s
saving up to go on a trip, founding a charity, or redesigning an apartment, these
couples can achieve anything when they cooperate.

Unbalanced Mediator–Diplomat Relationships
Emotional Burnout
As wonderful as strong, bonded emotions can be, maintaining such a deep
connection and constantly catering to each other’s feelings can exhaust even the
most emotionally attuned types. Mediator–Diplomat couples who become too
interdependent may not only lose their individual emotional stability, they may stifle
each other. Passionate desire for each other’s attention, reassurance, and company
becomes unbalanced when it approaches addictive need – risky on its own, and

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

88

Romantic Relationships

potentially overwhelming for overburdened partners with their own needs. When
these wonderfully interconnected partners take their emotional exchanges too far,
they can become codependent in all the wrong ways.
One of the biggest problems with this codependence is that it assumes too much:
everyone has limits. When Mediators or Diplomats take their adoration too far and
idealistically view their partners as their primary sources for emotional validation,
even minor flaws or missteps on the part of their lovers may seem shockingly
disappointing. Idolization of each other may be hard to avoid, especially when new
love is forming with truly remarkable individuals, but if it isn’t balanced with a little
realism, it can set up an overreaction. Mediators and Diplomats tend to be vulnerable
to having their high hopes dashed by reality, but when the source of their
disappointment are the people they love, the damage can be unpleasant. Blame is
often the result when codependent relationships begin to show their inevitable
weaknesses.
Lofty Distractions
Mediator–Diplomat couples have a troubling tendency to distract each other from
everyday realities. They often get lost in their shared world of ideas and possibilities,
drifting from one grand concept to another while ignoring immediate concerns.
While this can produce wonderful creativity and insight, it might not result in a stable
life. Without taking the time to enjoy the present and focus on simple realities,
practical sensibility can be lacking in these relationships. Setting unrealistic goals isn’t
always conducive to success, but these two types might never notice because they’re
so enthusiastically chasing potentials together. These couples can suffer very
unpleasant consequences when distraction leads to neglecting practical matters.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

89

Romantic Relationships

Mediator–Diplomat romantic relationships risk more than just daily upkeep,
however. They can develop grandiose plans that continually drain their resources,
never quite work out how they wanted, and eclipse much-needed pragmatic
planning. While mere striving may be satisfying, at some point, these couples can feel
a lack of realism in very basic ways. Lives spent painting or fighting injustice may have
tremendous spiritual payoffs, but even the most idealistic couples need a roof over
their heads and enough money to take care of themselves in retirement – and time
to slow down and just enjoy life.

Rebalancing Mediator–Diplomat Relationships
Individual Emotional Strength
Before seeking emotional fulfillment in each other, these partners can work to
develop their independence. One excellent way to do this is for Mediator–Diplomats
couples to do fun things apart from each other, as well as together. Whether
indulging in solitude or time spent with friends and family, these partners become
better sources of strength for each other when they’re strong on their own. Stepping
back now and then doesn’t in any way diminish their powerful connection, but it can
ensure that they stay in touch with themselves. Space is essential for authentic,
personal thoughts and feelings to be affirmed without anyone else’s energy in the
mix, and to rebalance their relationships, loving partners can respect the need for
this space.
This approach can also help rebalance one of the most unpleasant aspects of
emotional interdependence between Mediators and Diplomats: the tendency to
reflect each other’s negative emotional states. When feelings like joy or physical
arousal resonate between these two types, it can be a divine fire, indeed. But when

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

90

Romantic Relationships

one is stressed, tired, or irritable, the other may just as strongly amplify those
feelings. Sensitivity has its downside, and bad moods can be contagious. Avoiding
this pitfall requires conscious corrective action, and it isn’t always easy.
When confronted by something negative, it’s important to manage internal reactions:
These lovers must refuse each other’s negativity before it works its way into the heart
of the relationship. If one partner is upset by something external to their relationship,
the other can help by expressing sympathy without sharing their outrage – and they
can go further with a positive gesture, like a brief shoulder rub while their partner is
venting. In a relationship, these types can help each other by:
•

Taking time alone to focus on personal thoughts and emotions.

•

Balancing time spent together and socializing with others.

•

Gently declining to participate in each other’s negative emotions.

•

Projecting supportive, positive feelings in the face of each other’s upset.

There’s no magic bullet to prevent or resolve strong negative emotions, but putting
their underlying care for each other into practice can see these couples through
conflicts. Emotional individuality during good times can bolster these partners when
the going gets rough.
Balancing Dreams with Responsibility
To achieve balance between grand hopes and necessary realities, Mediator–
Diplomat couples must learn to engage in the present while still honoring their
expansive, creative tendencies. One way to do this is by regularly participating in
hands-on activities together. Working on home improvement projects, shopping
together, and being social with others are great ways for these couples to enjoy the
moment yet still enjoy each other’s inspired company. Having grand dreams is good,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

91

Romantic Relationships

but putting energy into practical activities together ensures that they don’t end up
living with their heads constantly in the clouds. This balance helps prepare them for
dealing realistically with more serious matters as well.
When less-pleasant responsibilities come knocking, Mediators and Diplomats can roll
up their sleeves, put on some music, and try to make the work as fun as possible.
Whether it’s fixing a leak, cleaning a room, or saving enough money for bills, both
these types benefit from companionship and help – working together with a cheerful
attitude creates momentum. No instruction can instill the needed will to accomplish
responsibilities, but these steps can bolster these couples’ commitment to get things
done:
•

Make time every week to complete minor, in-the-moment pursuits together.

•

Pick a chore day and make it a permanent part of the weekly schedule.

•

Ask each other what daily chores are being overlooked, and cooperate to get
them done.

•

Keep a list of needed chores and errands, share execution of list items.

•

Avoid putting things off: Do chores and errands as soon as possible, together
or independently.

For types so likely to get lost in their own imaginations, it’s very important to take
action. From simple camping trips, designing and building gardens, or sweeping the
floors, these couples can push themselves to move past the hoping and dreaming
phase and get to work on their goals.

Mediator–Sentinel Relationships

These relationships often bring about a kind of warm support that makes both types
feel secure and very well cared for. Mediators’ deep value of harmony with those
close to them combines with Sentinels’ sense of stability to create a love that fulfills
each partners’ needs very well. They may have radically different approaches to life
and internal motivations, but both place tremendous emphasis on having genuine,
trusting love in their lives, and this appreciation opens them up to learning from each
other’s differences.

Balanced Mediator–Sentinel Relationships
A Foundation of Mutual Benefit
Sentinels and Mediators share outlooks that can enable great relationships. Both
types sincerely want what’s best for people – Sentinels create stability and continuity,
and Mediators foster kindness and emotional support. These couples place great
emphasis on their values, and while they may have different approaches to
promoting their ideals, their underlying desire for harmony is a lifelong practice.
Balanced Sentinel–Mediator romantic partnerships combine their somewhat distinct

Romantic Relationships

values, and are based on mutual support, something that love easily brings out in
both types.
One of the best things about Mediator–Sentinel relationships is how they
compensate for each other’s behaviors. Sentinels can be a grounding influence on
sometimes-flighty Mediators by providing them with a stable perspective. Mediators
can provide their Sentinel lovers with deep understanding and empathy, as well as a
needed dose of inspiration. Their rich fantasy lives and gentle adventurousness can
help Sentinels break out of their reserved shells and realize their own potential.
When willing to appreciate each other’s strengths, these two types can learn much
about who they are, and who they can become.
Building a Rich Life Together
Mediators aren’t known for their pursuit of stability, but as they grow and experience
life, they realize the difference between freedom and chaos. Just as painters need
easels and musicians need their instruments, Mediators need the tools, knowledge,
and resources to achieve their idealistic, creative visions. Sentinel partners are
perfectly suited to helping them establish the underlying structure needed to pursue
their ideas and goals. Sentinels are known for being practical, industrious, and
sensible, and Mediators often need this kind of influence to move their lives forward.
Sentinels thrive on predictability, but even the most sensible goals can feel hollow
without warmth and companionship. Mediators offer their partners heartfelt
devotion unsurpassed by any other type. Sentinels’ efforts to keep their lives in order
are enhanced with deeper meaning when Mediators’ love enters their lives like rays
of sunshine – they can depend on having love at their side. Though they don’t each
bring the same things to a shared life, these two types build a more complete

Romantic Relationships

existence by embracing each other’s differences and giving generously of their own
virtues.

Unbalanced Mediator–Sentinel Relationships
Frustration with Follow-Through
Between these two types, partnerships don’t always go as planned. Sentinels may at
first be impressed by Mediators’ idealism, as their focus on social values likely
appeals to Sentinels’ sense of what is right and fair. However, once that first
impression fades, Sentinels may begin to question – at times justifiably – how
practical Mediators’ ideas are, and whether they’ll ever act on those ideas. Mediators
who don’t balance their imaginations with action may find their Sentinel lovers
dismissing their flexible, optimistic vision as impractical. When Sentinels let their
frustration get out of hand, they’ll very likely hurt Mediators with their criticism,
especially because there is often some truth behind it.
This frustration cuts both ways, though. Stabilizing is always on Sentinels’ minds, and
Mediators may initially appreciate the order their partners create – it likely
represents something they lack in their lives. However, with their attention to
tradition, Sentinels can seem rigid to Mediators, as though suffering from a lack of
vision or an inability to change. If Sentinels cling to predictability, Mediators can
become bored with the nuts and bolts of living in the present. Even worse, Sentinels
who place too much emphasis on consistency can make Mediators partners feel
trapped or suppressed, as though they can’t fully exercise their curiosity and
creativity – and to Mediators, these qualities are essential to a joyous life.

Different Timetables for Living
Mediators and Sentinels have potentially incompatible ways of scheduling their lives.
Typical Sentinels come up with a composed and detailed schedule that they stick to
dutifully, with everything in its place and on time. In contrast, Mediators prefer
making things up as they go along, and are comfortable abandoning something once
their interest wanes. They take a very relaxed and flexible approach to engagement
in the first place – things can happen whenever. Clearly, these two types can easily
get on each other’s nerves, especially since these different approaches affect so
many common aspects of life, like meeting for dates.
Misunderstandings and irritation abound when these two types feel their needs or
perspectives are being overlooked. Mediators may feel controlled when their
Sentinel partners pressure them to solidify or stick to their timetables, while
Sentinels can feel that Mediators are unreliable when they refuse. There’s obviously
great value in balancing planning with adaptation, but when these types refuse to
move toward such a combination, disagreements about which approach is correct
may turn toxic.

Rebalancing Mediator–Sentinel Relationships
Accomplishing Things Together
If both partners are open and willing to compromise, they can create balance. When
they feel appreciated, and appreciate their partner in turn, both will thrive. Mediators
can accomplish things that matter to both them and their partners by acting with the
same creative spirit that drives their imaginations. Sentinels, too, can keep an eye on
practical matters that Mediators might normally let slide, while also being more
flexible and open to trying fresh ideas and pursuits together. This doesn’t mean that

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

96

Romantic Relationships

Mediators expect Sentinels to keep things in order by themselves, or that Sentinels
can abandon themselves to the whims of Mediators – rather, they both balance
unconventional ideas with sensible action.
Sentinels respect those who follow through on their intentions, and are impressed
when Mediators show a willingness to roll up their sleeves and get to work. This
respect extends beyond practical or routine matters into personal interests as well.
Just as Sentinels appreciate Mediators’ participation in everyday responsibilities,
Sentinels can also recognize the value Mediators derive from working on their
creative dreams – and the truly dedicated Sentinels offer their help. Laundry and
finances are important, but for Mediators, life is pointless without being able to
dream their dreams, and Sentinels who want to create balanced, full relationships
support their partners’ personal priorities. Some basic steps that can help these two
share priorities include:
•

Be patient with each other’s limits and needs.

•

Give time and energy to each other’s goals, whether mundane or zany.

•

Decide priorities together, including completion times.

•

Set aside time every week for a session of work together.

•

Work together, and try to make it fun – without losing sight of goals.

A strong, loving commitment to each other can serve as an underlying reason for
these partners to be supportive – creative imagination and stable convention need
not be at odds if each type is willing to share their time and energy on what matters
to the other.

Romantic Relationships

The Best of Both
In real terms of everyday shared lives, rebalancing these couples’ scheduling
differences means compromising so that both types have what they want some of
the time. Sentinel partners can learn to be more spontaneous, even if it means
occasionally relaxing a schedule (or even going without). They can also recognize the
importance of respecting Mediators’ freedom and their right to change their minds.
Experiencing love and joy together gives Sentinels motivation to be patient and
accepting, and given how sensitive and concerned Mediators are, they’re unlikely to
push their partners too far out of their comfort zones.
In fact, Mediators can use their “go with the flow” attitude to their partners’ benefit,
letting Sentinels organize and direct plans and activities that are important to them,
especially those that are time-sensitive. Although overactive imaginations can
conjure plenty of arguments otherwise, tidy schedules rarely cause conflict, and most
Mediators benefit from increased structure in their lives. They can simply relax and
let Sentinels handle their schedule, ensuring that they’re ready to participate when
needed, and knowing that just as they revel in – and deserve – their wild and free
moments, Sentinels also deserve the satisfaction of things being on time. Here are
some steps that can enable workable compromises:
•

The Mediator comes up with fun ideas, and Sentinel partner plans these
experiences so that both can find enjoyment.

•

When timeliness is needed, like when arriving at the airport for a flight, agree
on plans together, and include a little extra time just in case.

•

Ensure that each type’s part of the plan is completed on time. Gently remind
each other of approaching deadlines.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

98

Romantic Relationships

•

Engage in unscheduled time together to explore in a moment-to-moment
context. Fairs, farmer’s markets, and other free-form events of mutual interest
fit the bill.

Each type in this coupling has certain strengths, and both types can take a step into
each other’s timeframes now and then. When it comes to recreation, Sentinels may
find it an unexpected relief to let go of rigid control, and Mediators can appreciate
the benefits of staying on schedule when it comes to important matters.

Mediator–Explorer Relationships

These pairings offer partners many adventures as their differences combine in
interesting and exciting ways. Mediators have heads full of creative dreams, and
Explorers tend to like hands-on activities – they may either baffle or inspire each
other at times. Mediators’ imaginations might not leap at the more material
challenges that appeal to Explorers, who, in turn, may become bored by imaginative
talk of the intangible, but love itself expands the horizons of both types as they
introduce each other to new things.

Romantic Relationships

Balanced Mediator–Explorer Relationships
Exploring Reality Together
Mediators tend to get lost in dreams on their own, but with Explorers by their sides,
they quickly find themselves drawn out of their heads and into experiences. Unusual
concepts appeal to both these types, and when deep imagination becomes the
launchpad for engagement, both can uncover new dimensions. When it comes to
creativity and ingenuity, these couples serve as uniquely different sources of
inspiration for each other, with Mediators providing a principled, highly imaginative
perspective, and Explorers excited to put ideas into a real-world context to see how
they work.
Together, these types are interested in exploring everything, always looking for
what’s new and exciting, and appreciating each other’s styles of engagement.
Explorer partners share Mediators’ wonderful sense of curiosity, and they also carry
that curiosity forward into action, trying to understand new things not just in theory,
but in practice. It’s very likely that these pairings result in lots of fun and adventure
together, not only making initial dating easier, but keeping things fresh as they
progress deeper into loving relationships.
Freedom Together
Another quality that both Mediators and Explorers share is a love of freedom. To be
happy, Mediators need to feel as though they can dream and create without
restraint, and likewise, Explorers want to walk their own path by engaging pursuits
that are important to them. While they may have different focuses and approaches,
these lovers share an essential desire to follow their hearts and minds wherever they
may lead. When love grows between them, they support each other’s liberty and

Romantic Relationships

passion. Because they know the importance of their own freedom, it makes sense to
both these types that their partners also want the freedom to explore; it’s normal to
them. Whereas some types might feel compelled to impose structure or restrictions,
these two types likely just say, “Go for it, babe!”
If loving something means setting it free, then Mediator–Explorer couples can truly
find empowerment in loving each other as they embrace their dreams and goals.
When a solid emotional connection ties them together, Mediators can happily grant
their Explorer partners the time and space they need to master whatever they set
their sights on, and, in turn, Explorers are unlikely to deny Mediators their grandest
hopes and ideas – though they might encourage them to do more than just dream.
These couples don’t hold each other to rigid standards or convention by any means,
as both are willing to adapt to new things all the time, and even seek them out. When
balanced in their support of each other’s interests, they can find endless happy
adventures together.

Unbalanced Mediator–Explorer Relationships
Why Don’t You Understand Me?
Despite their shared curiosity and adaptability, Mediators and Explorers have some
significant differences when it comes to imagination versus practicality. Mediators
who take their imagination too far can essentially end up living in a world of selfaffirmed realities, where what’s correct is based mainly on their own internal vision.
An unending obsession with concepts that never reach the real world can make even
the most flexible and permissive Explorers shake their heads in vexed wonderment.
These types may lose patience with Mediators who can’t bring themselves to face

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

101

Romantic Relationships

realities they don’t like, and, in turn, Mediators may see Explorers as sadly limited by
their inability to accept intangible truths.
Explorers specialize in real-world experimentation – they actively practice fitting
things together, with their ingenuity based heavily on adapting to feedback from their
environment. When something doesn’t turn out the way they hoped, they try a
different approach. Mediators, on the other hand, think about how purely conceptual
or intangible things might fit together, and can become blinkered by possibility. When
something doesn’t go as they hoped, these types often adapt to preserve the vision
in their heads: by fixing theoretical discrepancies in their minds, Mediators avoid
having to test their more outlandish ideas in the real world.
Shifting Sands
These lovers usually share enthusiasm for all that’s new and unknown, but their
willingness to dive headlong into change may result in shared risk. While they might
not lack for love and joy, even those things can be threatened if their lives become
too chaotic or fail to meet their basic needs. Prosperity, long-term success, and the
achievement of dreams often requires steady commitment and effort in ways that
don’t immediately pay off. These couples’ love of newness and change may distract
them from less thrilling, but no less important and rewarding, investments in
themselves and their future, as they’re often gleefully willing to shirk responsibilities.
Whether it’s failing to decide on an area of study, switching jobs too often, or simply
frittering away their time and resources on pleasure together, Mediators and
Explorers are by their very natures in danger of building their futures together on
shifting sands rather than worthy foundations. Most people don’t possess great
wealth, and so this can be a pernicious problem. If these types let their novelty-

seeking get out of hand, they may not stick to the same goals for very long, and while
this may be fine in discretionary personal pursuits, it can retard them in matters of
long-term development which are important to creating happy, successful lives.

Rebalancing Mediator–Explorer Relationships
Flexible with Each Other
Reconciling differences between airy, conceptual idealism and hands-on practicality
is a much-needed step for these couples to achieve balance. Luckily, their mutual
willingness to try new things offers them a clear path to accepting, if not always
understanding, each other’s styles. With a little tolerance, these two types see the
value in their different methods: Mediators see how well Explorers figure things out
through direct engagement, and Explorers see how insightful Mediators can be using
only their minds. The combination of unbound imagination and practical
experimentation is probably a superior approach to either method alone, and with
open minds, these couples can find a balance that allows them to operate together
with amazing results.
One of the biggest steps is for these couples to acknowledge individual priorities in
an affirmative way. Mediators can work to respect Explorers’ focus on tangible
accomplishments – they have every right to work on what matters to them. For their
part in rebalancing, Explorers might consider turning their masterful abilities to
helping their Mediator partners evolve some of their high-minded ideas into reality
– at least, the ones that can be translated into reality. Of course, Explorers can’t be
expected to merely occupy an intangible realm, so when Mediators ask their partners
to join in, they must also be ready for action. Here are some steps to creating balance
in this area:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

103

Romantic Relationships

•

Give each other the respect and space to do personal things in unique ways.

•

Explain their approach and why it’s important to them, including how it makes
them feel.

•

Show personal and individual methods to each other and explain how they
work.

•

Try out the other’s approach, preferably within an activity that’s of interest to
both, and done together, as experience creates understanding.

These types can tap into their love of novelty and explore each other’s methods. The
simplest way is just to join each other in personal pursuits with open hearts and
minds – neither type needs to convert, but they can both experiment with different
perspectives and methods.
Building a Foundation
Communication and cooperation are very important to rebalancing these couples’
potential to meander through life. If they want to achieve meaningful long-term
goals, they’ll have to willingly take care of responsibilities together. Learning to
regularly communicate about topics that are difficult or uninteresting is a sign of both
personal maturity and mature relationships. Even if these partners are happily
tolerant of disorder, or prefer keeping their options open, talking through a budget,
social schedule, housekeeping, and meal planning are essential steps to keeping
their homes and relationships running smoothly.
Mediator–Explorer couples tend to dislike boring responsibilities, and this poses
great challenges. While they may find happiness living outside convention, they do
need responsibility enough to recognize what they’ll need to remain content and
secure in the long term. This may mean different things to different couples, but
typically entails more work, saving, or daily chores – and in any case, it requires a

104

Romantic Relationships

serious attitude from both partners. In realistic terms, this means they dedicate time
every week to attend their responsibilities together. These types may find it easier to
maintain discipline when they view it as an expansion of their desires; these goals
are for their own benefit. Steps they can take to help with goal-setting and
engagement include:
•

Discuss and decide on a few long-term goals that are important to both.
o What are they? Why are they important? What resources will they
require?

•

Defining for each other what success would look like, and how completion will
be measured.

•

When considering whether these goals are achievable, ask trustworthy people
with related experience for their opinions and advice.

•

Set a realistic timeframe for these goals, considering probable limits and other
obligations.

•

Commit to a schedule for working on these goals together.

•

As you work, prioritize a positive attitude and encouragement.

•

Sticking to the plan as much as possible. Adjust only if necessary – an ideal
plan accounts for variations and contingencies.

With a shared focus, these couples can translate their desires into real world results
that keep them happy – not just in the moment, but for years to come. By working
together, they can create enjoy the benefits of stability as they lead spontaneous,
light-hearted lives.

Conclusion
Staying True to Their Hearts
Mediators have a sensitive core that often makes it challenging for them to be bold,
especially when it comes to critical social endeavors like romance. No other type is
more sweet, thoughtful, and responsive to other people’s influence, and it’s this very
receptiveness that grants them many advantages in love. Deeply empathetic and
open-hearted, when Mediators love someone, they not only welcome them into their
lives, they’re willing to accept and revere them as they are. They can forge rewarding
relationships with any type, and when they meet others who truly appreciate and
respect them in return, balanced love knows no limits.
If there’s any cautionary theme for Mediators in love, it’s not to lose themselves
completely in their adoration of their partners. These types so readily give of
themselves that they may forego their happiness as individuals. Loving partners can
give them what they need, either supporting them actively or just giving them time
for themselves, but Mediators must remember to communicate these needs.
Conforming to partners can create great closeness, but love only grows so much in
an echo chamber – those who truly love Mediators want to see them honestly, and
revel in their uniqueness.
When Mediators share themselves without shame, they may be surprised at how
attractive they are to other people. Their ability to care for others on an emotional
level, combined with their insightful imaginations and love of novelty and
spontaneity, make Mediators appealing partners to all types of people. As Introverts,
putting themselves forward socially comes with great effort, but they nonetheless
benefit from doing so. Accepting themselves as wonderful and cherished can be a

powerful step toward meeting their goals of personal growth, as well as finding true
love.

Friendships

Friendships

Private and Mysterious
Mediators are one of the most private personality types, a quality which comes
through in all their relationships, including friendships. Despite this, they quickly “get”
both their current and potential friends, as they possess incredible insight when it
comes to other people. Even though they’re adept at reading others, these types
usually keep to themselves when it comes to their own thoughts and feelings.
Mediators would rather direct a conversation toward universal ideas than reveal
anything about their inner lives, at least until they can be sure that the potential
confidant is receptive. They maintain this mysterious aura even with their dearest
friends, and they require a profound sense of trust to let others in. This can make
things interesting, albeit lopsided; in friendships with Mediators, the central task for
both people is to create that trust. Nonetheless, if they want the friendship to work,
they need to take that risk: There is no real friendship between two strangers,
however appealing the notion.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

108

Friendships

The first step to having friends is meeting people, which Mediators find difficult.
When they’re younger, their sensitivity may cause them to choose solitude rather
than face the stressors and emotionally charged situations that often come with even
simple social engagements. This tendency may linger in older Mediators as well.
Being alone may not bother them most of the time, but when they do yearn for
supportive and stimulating relationships, they need to set aside their self-protection
and reach out. For these types, isolation is more reflexive than intentional.
Sincerity and Authenticity
For their friendship, all Mediators ask in return is sincerity. Genuine behavior is vital
to them, and they won’t let people they see as inauthentic into their lives
unnecessarily. These types possess a powerful filter that helps them determine who
is genuine and who is not, so insincere candidates for friendship are usually revealed
and left alone long before they get too close.
Mediators’ preference for deep conversation over small talk helps them sort the
potentials from the pretenders, and they’re unlikely to form real friendships with
mere acquaintances. The fact that individuals share the same spot in time and space
isn’t enough to warrant their commitment to a closer connection. Nor will they seek
friendships based on everyday activities where chit-chat is the chief form of
communication. Passionate in their idealism, Mediators search for those willing to
imaginatively climb to the greatest heights with them.
Supportive, Loyal, and Deep
Once Mediators establish a degree of trust and begin to develop genuine friendships,
they’re fiercely loyal, supporting their hard-won friends with singular devotion.
Because of all the “trust work” leading up to their bonding, these types are usually

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

109

Friendships

unwilling to let something so meaningful slip away. Mediators show extraordinary
levels of caring and compassion to keep their friends safe and happy.
Supporting and caring for others are integral to Mediators’ identity – and they have
hope that even those with the most abhorrent behaviors can be redeemed by love.
Their personal view of support sometimes informs their opinion of how others
should be with them. Mediators keep their circle of friends small, relying far more on
depth than breadth. However, if they need lots of support, they have only a few
kindred souls to lean on. This alone isn’t problematic, but they may become needy
or even overbearing in their friendships. Their chosen few friends receive the full
weight of Mediators’ needs, and it takes a special sort to balance it.
All friendships need some measure of trust, loyalty, support, and authenticity, but
Mediators need these to be the defining elements. Add idealism to the mix, and the
depths of their relationships become quite profound. Because Mediators go to so
much trouble to build friendships, they treasure them greatly and are likely to keep
such friends for life. Even though they’re not always the most consistent people,
friendship is one area where they’re steadfast.
“I’m Going on an Adventure”
Invitations to Mediators’ life journeys may come with some significant barriers.
Finding friends willing to suspend their approaches to life long enough to share in
Mediators’ unique way of thinking and feeling is challenging. If they don’t have
substantial common ground to cement their relationships, it can be near impossible.
At the same time, Intuitive types can find it exhausting to convert their imaginings
into something tangible, and Introverts can exaggerate their concerns about
relationships, seeing other people as something to “deal with.” For Prospecting types,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

110

Friendships

there can even be a sense of apprehension about entering what might be perceived
as a commitment from which they may need to extract themselves. For Mediators, a
social life might seem like a burden.
To work through this, these types can reframe social interactions to appeal to their
adventurousness, open-mindedness, and creativity – the parts of themselves that
dream up grand stories and long to explore. Rather than “dealing with” people, they
can try to see friendships as quests of discovery. In classic tales of adventure and
fantasy, the occasional dragons do crop up – but that’s what makes a quest so darn
exciting!
There may be confusion and chaos along the way, little embarrassments and
miscommunications, but these setbacks emerge within a healthy friendship as part
of a shared adventure. So much depends on the mindset with which Mediators build
their social worlds. Will they be haunted by obligation and embarrassment – or
inspired by quests filled with adventure?

Mediators and Friends from Other Roles
Friendship isn’t simply about Mediators and some other generic person. Each Role –
Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers – brings something unique to their
friendships. How their distinct traits interact with Mediators’ tendencies creates
unique synergies and challenges.
The next four sections explore how Mediators and people from each Role relate to
each other as friends. First, we look at what a balanced friendship looks like, when
companions understand each other, lift each other up, cover each other’s
weaknesses, and enable each other’s strengths. Then, we discuss an unbalanced

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

111

Friendships

friendship, one in which friends exaggerate each other’s weaknesses or disregard
each other’s needs. Finally, we explore rebalancing friendships. Just because things
hit a rough patch doesn’t mean they can’t find a way back to positivity and mutual
growth, and this book works to help friends do just that.

Mediator–Analyst Friendships

If a cartoonish archetype were created to represent an association between Analysts
and Mediators, it might involve a scientist (the Analyst) and a poet (the Mediator).
The scientist would explain things with unrelenting rationality and far more detail
than was perhaps needed. The poet would rhapsodize in free verse, converting a
clinical analysis into something almost beautiful. Although the caricatures represent
a contrasting undercurrent that certainly exists, the two types aren’t so distant –
Mediators and Analysts can become great friends.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Balanced Mediator–Analyst Friendships
Unlimited Potential
Their interests usually differ, but Mediators and Analysts both share the Intuitive
trait, which bestows a fondness for abstract ideas and “what if” scenarios, with
Mediators offering the softer side of reality. They certainly come from different
perspectives, but their creative approaches and open minds come together
beautifully. Mediators put heart and soul into their ideas, incorporating a sense of
humanity and morality – even spirituality. Analysts put a rational spin on these ideas,
always in pursuit of efficient, elegant solutions. Also, Mediators have grand visions
for the future, but they struggle to work toward those goals in any tangible way. At
times, they have trouble finding a realistic direction or deciding which of many paths
is viable. Analysts can help Mediators bridge the gap between their dreams and
reality. Their differences have the potential for conflict, but mature, accepting friends
can complement each other wonderfully.
Mediators’ plans change or evolve frequently, but for their dreams to come to
fruition, they need enough stability to see ideas to completion. Analysts can be hitand-miss on stability, but they add a dose of criticism that, although sometimes hard
to hear (and not just because Mediators are sensitive – Analysts are notoriously
blunt), can help shape a dream into something achievable. Analysts focus on rational
plans that deconstruct concepts and systems to find their flaws and make them work
better. This clarity can anchor Mediators’ goals and dreams to make them feasible.
Finding Their Center
In a sense, Mediators and their Analyst friends act as interpreters and guides for each
other. Mediators translate the world of humanistic concerns for their Analyst friends,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

113

Friendships

while Analysts open the door to rational options for their Mediator friends. Mediators
bring a soft-hearted approach to the world, choosing to believe in hope and
kindness. In a friendship, this may rebalance Analysts’ sometimes cynical outlook on
the world.
Mediators serve Analyst friends as trusted guides on their journeys as well. Analysts
are geared to consider logic before emotion. Some Analysts might even fear
emotions, including their own, as a loss of self-control, a common misunderstanding
about emotional expression. When Mediators help Analysts navigate this sea of
feelings and understand themselves, it can add tremendous depth to both of their
lives and to their friendships.

Unbalanced Mediator–Analyst Friendships
If either person leans on their core traits in an unbalanced way, there can be ample
pitfalls in Mediator–Analyst friendships. This is primarily due to how they reach
decisions. Rational, efficient Analysts and dreamy, empathic Mediators can certainly
complement each other and hold each other accountable, but they can engage in
some serious clashes as well.
Criticism as Support
Mediators and Analysts may have occasional tension in their friendships, especially
if they aren’t comfortable enough with themselves to be able to accept others as they
are, which is a matter of personal growth. Tension can arise from the distinct filters
they tend to use to make decisions: emotional humanism versus detached
rationalism. It’s all too easy for these friends to forget at times just how differently
they think. If forthright individuals feel strongly about an issue, they can easily upset
each other.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

114

Friendships

Mediators are sensitive to criticism and tension, and Analysts are often gleefully
provocative. When Analysts forget their Mediator friends’ feelings, their behavior can
become an unbalanced type of debate that can seem more like an attack. When
Mediators forget that ideological arguments are akin to an intellectual game to
Analysts, they can overreact with raw emotion, fleeing from the situation instead of
playing along. Although their emotions may not be as near the surface, Analysts
nonetheless feel such accusations very deeply when they come from a friend.
Profundity and Play
Mediators tend to take their ideas seriously, and they wish desperately that they
could follow through with most of them. Applying their earnestness to their Analyst
friends’ sometimes bizarre plans could be disturbing. Meanwhile, Analysts may
mistakenly interpret Mediators’ ideals as being just as fanciful as their own.
Mediators seriously wonder whether they should sell everything they own to pursue
their dreams – change their lives so they might change the lives of others. Analysts
treat Mediators’ thoughts as they do their own; consequently, they may trivialize
what is most important to Mediators, hurting them in the process.
Analysts often brainstorm and come up with outrageous plans and ideas simply as
an exercise in rationality. These types have no intention of their schemes leading to
anything, even as they take a raw idea and refine it to the detail of a manual. For
example, Analysts may talk at length about how to execute the perfect bank robbery,
with surprisingly detailed knowledge of security and money-laundering practices
seemingly conjured from nowhere – but local banks are probably safe. However,
Mediators equate thought with action on a certain level, judging themselves harshly
for any slips into the sort of amoral thoughts Analysts can contemplate with relative

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

115

Friendships

dispassion. Seeing that their friends have no qualms with this can undermine
Mediators’ trust.
They can find each other intriguing at first, but if they don’t work to understand each
other, Analysts will keep trying to get their Mediator friends to take a break from
fanciful dreams, and Mediators will begin to feel sadness for their Analyst friends,
who seem to see nothing as sacred.

Rebalancing Mediator–Analyst Friendships
Mediators and Analysts always have one thing in common: They share the Intuitive
trait. This characteristic allows them to see the world with a broader perspective.
With their mental flexibility, Intuitive types are the best-equipped to find the
understanding needed to rebalance a friendship, as well as appreciate each other’s
strengths and weaknesses.
Friendships should make each companion intellectually and spiritually larger, not
smaller. Each personality type should temper their thinking and appreciate the
unique perspectives their friends bring to the table. Friendships between Mediators
and Analysts provide opportunities to do just that – but first, they need to
acknowledge and set aside any intolerance of their differences, just long enough to
get to the people underneath.
A Teachable Moment
Mediators know well the strength that comes from emotional honesty and
understanding. One of Analysts’ greatest weaknesses is their underdeveloped
emotional intelligence – or, more accurately, their dismissal of emotional intelligence
as valuable or even valid. Mediators have the patience and the skill with words (not

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

116

Friendships

to mention the emotional understanding needed to relate to others) to open this
perspective up to their Analyst friends. There is an entire half of the world that
Analysts just factor out of their calculations – those who rely on sensitivity and
emotional context to make decisions.
There can be no better guides into this new world than Mediator friends. They
prompt their Analyst friends to consider how others might feel, then help them
adjust their plans and ideas. Of course, for proper balance, Mediators need to open
themselves to similar teachable moments based on Analysts’ more rational
perspective. The following tips can help:
•

Understand that Analysts initially use logic in situations.
o They’re exceptionally precise people, which is why any emotional
response they have will usually be a delayed one. Just as Mediators
would have an issue stepping away from their feelings, Analysts would
have issue stepping away from rationality.

•

When pondering on a seemingly emotionless response from an Analyst, try to:
o Not immediately take it personally.
o Take a step back from the response and consider whether it was
intended to hurt.
o If is unsure, ask the Analyst as plainly as possible.
Appreciating Limits

Mediators hold their emotions very dear, and Analysts are notoriously insensitive to
emotional cues. Mediators who’d like to balance out their Analyst friendships can
start by letting their friends know that certain topics aren’t game for criticism. This is
hardly the ideal way to start friendships, but for friends trying to repair damage,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

117

Friendships

letting each other know that something is problematic is a sign of honest
communication, something valuable in any relationship.
It’s also an opportunity for Mediators’ personal growth. These types sacrifice
themselves for others’ benefit, so standing up for their feelings can be a tremendous
boost to self-confidence – Analysts respect such clear statements, and they’re usually
happy to oblige. Setting aside known flashpoints for conflict is straightforward and
efficient as well. Having some informal rules when there are subjects that prove too
contentious may help keep the peace, as well as keep these friendships from falling
apart.
Here are some ways Mediators can work on appreciating their own and their friends’
limits:
•

Consider a recent situation where you felt hurt or angered by a friend.

•

Identify the specific issue and why it hurt.
o For example, an Analyst friend telling you to “suck it up” during a time
of great emotional distress. Such a statement can hurt, making you feel
as though you can’t talk to them when you need someone to turn to.

•

Once you have the issue clearly defined, sit your Analyst friend down and:
o Use “I feel” statements (“I feel really hurt that my emotions were ignored
yesterday,” rather than an accusatory, “You’re incredibly insensitive.”)
o Avoid any emotional flourishes or poetic language. Analysts do well with
precise language, and they can understand an emotional dilemma
better if it’s delivered this way.
o Be as straight to the point as possible, but also clear. This is important
because Analysts may have a harder time relating to Mediators’ poetic

118

Friendships

descriptions of their feelings. If they’re hurt, Mediators should simply
say, “I was hurt.”

Mediator–Diplomat Friendships

Mediators find a natural home with their fellow Diplomats. They come together
easily, as their interactions are based on a common interest in humanistic topics, a
strong concern for society and those adversely affected by it, and good intentions to
make the world a better place. Considering all of this, it isn’t unsurprising that
Mediators and other Diplomats make for amazing friends.

Balanced Mediator–Diplomat Friendships
For Mediators, close friendships with fellow Diplomats can feel like befriending
themselves. The common interests and shared temperament among Diplomats
make for powerful influences. Diplomats live more internally than most types and
exercise their imaginations extravagantly. This enables Mediators to sit quietly and
comfortably with their friends without saying much at all. When they do talk,
however, these types are unlikely to run out of things to say.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

119

Friendships

Because they’re rare in a constellation of personality types, Diplomat friends work to
maintain such precious friendships, regardless of any difficulties they might
encounter along the way. When they see all they have in common, they strive to
create lifelong bonds.
A Mental and Emotional Extension
Mediators who form genuine friendships with other Diplomats have the wonderful
experience of gaining a kind of mental extension of themselves, as they magnify their
potential for joy and learning. Although Mediators are often overly private in their
relationships, Diplomats can help Mediators express themselves in an emotionally
safe environment. Should Mediators overcome their caution and share with
Diplomat friends, they’ll enjoy relatable insights and gain the benefit and wisdom of
each other’s tests and triumphs. “I had the most amazing idea the other day …” is a
common refrain in these friendships. In a sense, their honest and profound
relationships offer each partner a chance to live two lives at once.
Likewise, Mediators and Diplomats are ideally suited to provide care for each other
in times of trouble. An in-depth personal knowledge of each other’s way of thinking,
combined with their nurturing nature, make them ideal confidants and emotional
resources for each other. Each knows what the other needs, or has the patience and
understanding to find out. Sometimes they offer comfort, encouragement, and
sympathy. At other times, they provide a firm metaphorical kick to snap friends out
of a funk. The mutual understanding these types share may reach an almost mystical
synchronicity.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

120

Friendships

A Creative Bond
When it comes to pursuing creativity and ideas together, Mediators find that other
Diplomats make willing and helpful partners. In fact, mutual interests often bring
these types together in the first place. They might build their friendships around
reading a favorite genre of fiction, pursuing social causes, or even forming a band.
Diplomats don’t just “hang out.” For these types, exploring life via deep conversations
is relaxing. Mediators look for personal ways to express and understand such
insights, often in very creative ways, and other Diplomats make ideal partners in such
endeavors.
When Mediators and their Diplomat friends have mutual creative interests, they
inspire each other to go deeper, spurring significant accomplishments and
understanding. This supportive energy comes from core similarities tied to broad
human and moral themes. However, they don’t always think about things the same
way. Differences between friends who feel they know each other so well can be
unsettling but aren’t to be feared. They even hold special benefits. By weaving
together their harmonious but independent paths, these companions can glimpse a
different point of view that stirs up deep feelings because they’re so similar and yet
unique.
Advocate and Protagonist friends, who bear the Judging trait, bring a special gift to
their friendships with Mediators. They help to ground Mediators in their creative
endeavors, encouraging depth and follow-through. Mediators’ approach to life is a
lot more inspiration-oriented than that of Judging Diplomats. Although Mediators’
flexibility and lack of conformity can certainly lead to something beautiful when their
creative juices are flowing, it’s just as likely they’ll only hint at that beauty before

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

121

Friendships

moving on. Judging Diplomats may be able to help their Mediator friends focus on
their goals, and perhaps even meet them.

Unbalanced Mediator–Diplomat Friendships
Isolated and Insulated
Adding varied thoughts to the mix can make ideas stronger. However, Mediator–
Diplomat friendships sometimes build a psychological “bubble” that keeps them
insulated from the critical input of outsiders. This is magnified if the friends are also
Introverts. A bubble is a cozy place for private Mediators, and it’s tempting to take
advantage of relationships that promote such isolation.
The key challenge for Mediator and Diplomat friends comes from the same source
that fuels their friendships – their similarity. Having friends who think the same way
is reassuring and comfortable. However, when they’re isolated from diverse opinions
and rely only on each other, these types can find themselves lacking useful feedback
and perspective. This creates the risk that they’ll support each other’s ways of
thinking despite critical flaws that more objective types would quickly notice.
Subconscious Manipulation
Similarity might also lead Mediator and Diplomat friends to manipulate each other
subconsciously. Mediators don’t consciously seek power over others, especially
through manipulation, and they aren’t likely to try to pull the wool over another’s
eyes. Their empathy and their quest for genuineness stifle such impulses.
Nonetheless, they do know what makes other Diplomats tick. If their friends have an
agenda that doesn’t quite match theirs, Mediators may find themselves bending the
rules and subtly discouraging their friends from certain paths by showing a little extra

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

122

Friendships

disappointment. They know what kind of doubts resonate, and manipulation can
become accidentally effortless.
Mediators’ deep trust allows them to be manipulated by people they care about, too.
These types are “harmonizers,” often willing to quickly set aside their own needs in
favor of their friends’ needs. This can lead to a sort of manipulation if friends use
Mediators’ need for harmony to their own benefits. Despite the empathic gifts typical
to Diplomats, trust can run so deep between these friends that they neglect deeper
concerns about fair and humane treatment. People sometimes aren’t even aware of
these unhealthy influences existing in their friendships.
It’s important to keep in mind, however, that manipulation and compromise are two
different things. The thing to ask is, “Does one of us always get our way?” Compromise
goes two ways, while manipulation tends to work for only one.

Rebalancing Mediator–Diplomat Friendships
Rediscovering the Tangible
Balancing their inner, imaginative lives with some real-world experiences is a huge
benefit to Mediators and their Diplomat friends. Instead of only encouraging each
other to live internally, these types can make it a point to get out and experience the
world. Such an effort at balancing their lives – with local fairs, the arts, or live music
– can only make their friendships richer. There’s nothing wrong with watching and
discussing a film, but perhaps a few frames of bowling or a spontaneous hike would
expand their lives through novelty and variety. For a pair that otherwise lives through
the imagination, a little interaction with the material world usually feels great.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

123

Friendships

Part of getting out into the world is meeting other people and including them in
discussion and activities. This might be a challenge for Mediators alone, but with help
and encouragement from Diplomat friends, they may be able to achieve it (finding
events of mutual interest that allow for groups might be a good plan). Here are a few
suggestions:
•

Make time to do things to learn real-life skills together (e.g., woodworking,
cooking classes).

•

Focus on things both enjoy that require attendance or active participation.

•

Try and pick things that exercise basic skills in a hands-on way, such as painting
or tennis.

•

Spend time with other types of friends to avoid isolation.
Thinking Critically

Mediators and Diplomat friends can rebalance subtle manipulations by focusing on
sharing their own feelings, thoughts, and ideas. These friends carry a certain gravity
with each other because of the trust inherent in the relationship, but there is a
difference between subtle pressure and honest, gentle sharing. That may be a
difference that Mediators want to fine-tune, especially in friendships with Diplomats,
where emotions abound, and harmony is prized over all else. Mediator–Diplomat
friends likely don’t want to reject each other’s criticisms or concerns when they come
from a good place, but realizing that manipulation can also take this form will raise
awareness when it’s happening.
Words like “manipulation” may sound harsh or unlikely, but it’s important to
understand that we’re talking about subconscious thinking, not deliberate
machinations. In fact, conscious manipulation is a betrayal of trust that these

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

124

Friendships

sensitive friends find repugnant, and in that, we can see the key to rebalancing.
Because these friends care so genuinely for each other’s well-being, merely
mentioning the appearance of any unfair pressure will hit home and likely halt it.
When one of these friends takes the time to gently express their concerns, the other
will quickly look at their own behavior anew, then do whatever it takes to restore
balance. Here’s a few pieces of advice that can help restore balance:
•

Express criticism as constructive concern, openly and without emotional
pressure.

•

Don’t be afraid to respectfully consider but reject each other’s advice.

•

Make appreciation clear to each other while staying firmly on a personal path.

•

Try not to get too caught up in each other’s emotions. A little distance can
enable better objectivity and, ultimately, better care for each other.

It’s important for these friends to be supportive, not controlling. It’s enough to
honestly make their opinions known and offer their help to each other; they don’t
need to feel responsible for each other’s decisions, nor take each other’s
independence as rejection. Instead of trying to push each other subtly, they can give
their support to the directions each chooses for themselves.

Mediator–Sentinel Friendships

Mediators and Sentinels may seem like opposites – the hopeful dreamers and the
keepers of society don’t seem like they would be a natural fit. However, their
opposing traits can be balanced out if both are willing to work together to create a
strong and everlasting friendship.

Balanced Mediator–Sentinel Friendships
A Study in Contrasts
Sentinels, as the most common personality types by far, likely make up some if not
most of Mediators’ circles of friends. This is despite some marked trait differences
between these types. The closest Sentinel match to Mediators are Defenders, who
share the Introversion and Feeling traits. Executives, however, differ on every core
attribute. Nonetheless, they have a common interest in caring about others. For
Mediators, this comes from a kind of dreamy, romantic sense of altruism. For
Sentinels, it originates from a more practical place, rooted in everyday concerns,
common sense, and loyalty.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

126

Friendships

In the right spirit, Mediator–Sentinel friends can use their differences to share the
best of two worlds. While Mediators explore the vast reaches of their imaginations
to discover how the planet might be a better place, their Sentinel friends work on it
in detail with steady, measurable progress. When Mediators reveal far-flung utopian
ideas to their Sentinel friends, Sentinels temper the concepts with practical
considerations. When Sentinels embrace the more pedestrian aspects of life,
Mediators can pull them toward more interesting ways of considering their existence
and possibilities for society. A dialectical push and pull between such friends evens
out extremes, and stretching in these ways promotes growth for both.
Feet on the Ground, Heads in the Clouds
Mediators balance their Sentinel friends’ perspectives by taking them on tours of
profound thoughts and unusual perspectives. Their influence can help Sentinel
friends to mitigate boredom, breaking them out a bit when life becomes confining.
Mediators can help Sentinels relax their tendency to be adamantly purposeful,
providing them with relief from their abundant responsibilities. Mediators help their
Sentinel friends balance their approach to spontaneity, flexibility, and fancy. “We
don’t need a plan,” might be the Mediator’s rallying cry to their regimented Sentinel
friends.
Mediators see life creatively and hopefully by way of their imagination, whereas
Sentinels focus on far more concrete matters. When Mediators wrap themselves up
in thoughts and theories, they can expect Sentinel friends to draw them out of their
reverie and into the material world. After chatting about the nature of humanity or
watching thought-provoking movies, Sentinels may get their Mediator friends to the
park or out for a day of shopping, at least occasionally. Sentinel friends can help
Mediators appreciate and enjoy life in more tangible, fun ways.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

127

Friendships

Such friendships involve companions sharing their distinct views of life. Mediators
peer through a looking glass that whisks them away from the here and now, and
Sentinels use a magnifying glass to appreciate the controllable details that are within
reach. Both can be interesting perspectives. Such friends might suggest to each
other, “Here, try looking at things through mine for a minute.”

Unbalanced Mediator–Sentinel Friendships
Stubborn Misunderstanding
Trouble can begin in Mediator–Sentinel friendships when either insists that their way
is the better way. Mediators may have more patience with Sentinels who possess the
Feeling trait (Defenders and Consuls), but they may hit a brick wall with Thinking
Sentinels (Executives and Logisticians). When Sentinels hold on to their established
patterns and Mediators hold onto their ideals, it can be an unstoppable force
meeting an immoveable object.
Instead of relying on the steadying influences of their Sentinel friends, Mediators may
be tempted to think of themselves as deeper and more substantial. These types can
be very intensely involved with their own thoughts and feelings, which is why they
sometimes make the mistake of believing that others cannot possibly feel or see life
as they do. Mediators disregard the everyday details that Sentinels often
painstakingly attend to: Mediators will discard tradition, community, and the status
quo if they’re not in line with their personal ideals. Sentinels can feel frustrated by
this disregard, and when they insist on their own values, Mediators may condescend,
and in the eyes of Sentinel friends that comes across as out-of-touch elitism.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

128

Friendships

The Concept Versus the Details
These friends can balance each other’s lives, but if they criticize each other’s
methods, such behavior can lead to conflict and tension. Both types tend to have an
idea of what they want to achieve, but they may go about it in very different ways.
Mediators organize their worlds around opportunity and inspiration, whereas
Sentinels organize their worlds around details and stability. This can become an issue
when they try to work together toward a common goal, such as a social endeavor or
shared outing.
Mediators’ focus on the intangible becomes unbalanced when it leads to indifference
or irresponsibility, such as the details of executing mutual activities. They may act
based on unrealistic expectation more than sensible assessment, causing plans to
falter or go awry in ways that frustrate Sentinels, who think they can see how
problems could have been avoided. Sentinels, on the other hand, might insist too
rigidly on details, hanging their own – and others’ – happiness on procedural matters
instead of a broader outcome of fun and enjoyment. Although neither intends to be
intolerant of the other’s style, it can turn out that way when these friends make plans
together.

Rebalancing Mediator–Sentinel Friendships
Appreciating Fundamental Differences
For these types, having fun together requires an understanding that they may have
divergent definitions of fun. One of the first steps to closing the gap between
Mediators’ conceptual focus and Sentinels’ pragmatic view is simply to acknowledge
that difference. Although there may never be a full meeting of the minds, there can
be a meeting of the hearts and a sense of acceptance and mutual respect. With

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

129

Friendships

patience, each can work to understand that the other is coming from a good place,
which creates common ground for enjoying each other’s company.
It’s a fool’s errand to ask Mediators to be less passionate, or Sentinels to relax their
need to maintain practical control. However, the best way forward is to experience
each other’s worlds, at least a little – they needn’t lose who they are or cease counterbalancing each other. Sentinels can still ask their Mediator friends to take a deep
breath when they’re too distracted with new ideas or passions, and Mediators can
still ask their Sentinel friends to lighten up a bit when they’re obsessed with serious
responsibilities. The mere intent to accept and explore each other’s ways a little at a
time will be enough to rebalance this caring friendship. To achieve this, both friends
can do the following:
•

Respect each other’s differences.

•

Ask questions about how each other’s differences are applied in daily life.
o Whey they have differences in opinion, Mediators can gently inquire
why Sentinels do things the way they do.

•

Try and glimpse things from each other’s point of view.

•

Make time to do things together that appeal mainly to one friend, then
alternate fairly.

Whether it’s a movie or politics, these two will likely always have to make room for
each other’s different styles. However, belief that their approaches are just fine for
themselves also means they must give each other the respect to do things their way
– treating each other as they wish to be treated.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

130

Friendships

Understanding Is Caring
Mediators should recognize that it’s no small thing to disrupt Sentinels’ best-laid
plans. Sentinels take their responsibilities seriously, and they can harbor hurt
feelings over disruptions of their code, even those that seem minor. Mediators can
rebalance such missteps not only by letting their compassion open the door to
compromise, but also by taking time to appreciate what Sentinels contribute to
shared plans. It’s great to have a grand concept of a fun shared activity, but ensuring
that things are planned – and executed well enough to meet those lofty expectations
– can lead to even more fun. Recognizing the value of Sentinels’ realistic logistics not
only demonstrates respect, but it also helps Mediators learn a skill that will help them
accomplish their enthusiastic hopes.
For their part, Sentinels should try not to control every little detail; making something
happen in a successful and fun way doesn’t require absolute predictability. Sentinels
are unlikely to allow themselves to be carried away by abstract concepts or stretched
profundity, but they can open themselves up to being flexible and enjoying the
moment. They can rebalance their rigidity by realizing that sometimes tight control
of an endeavor severely limits its potential. Indeed, Mediators’ seemingly “unrealistic”
hopes may be the first step toward unexpected, amazing experiences together. Here
are some tips that can help these friends rebalance their differing ideas of how to
have fun:
•

Join in things that matter to each other.

•

Appreciate being with friends, even if the activity isn’t very engaging.

•

Try to respect the specificity of friends’ needs, even if it makes no sense to you.

•

Ask each other what to do to support each other’s goals of fun.

Ultimately, friends are friends. Even though Mediators and Sentinels are sometimes
caught off-guard by the distinct ways they approach activities, they can have even
more fun together when they focus on each other’s unique contributions.

Mediator–Explorer Friendships

When Mediators and Explorers come together, there is no limit to the joy that can be
had. Both have the Prospecting trait, leading them to venture the world as their will
commands – just in different ways. Though some work is required, with ample
understanding these two types can become the best of friends.

Balanced Mediator–Explorer Friendships
Two Kinds of Explorers
Mediators have much in common with Explorers. In a sense, Mediators are explorers
(small “e”) themselves. Like Explorers, they often go in non-conformist directions and
approach life as something flexible and laden with possibility. Mediators and
Explorers enjoy novelty, adding new elements to their personal worlds. Although

Friendships

Mediators usually focus on ideas and philosophies, Explorers hone in on skills and
experiences. They may show it in different ways, but they’re both free spirits.
Mediators act as a stabilizing moral compass. Woven into their philosophical
exploration, there is always a sense of empathy, compassion, concern for well-being
and fairness, and a broad philosophy of humanism. This helps Explorer friends weigh
the impact of their choices on others and themselves. Explorers help their Mediator
friends realize that wondering and pondering are well and good, but sometimes, they
just need to do. This can be especially potent in travel – bringing philosophical
wanderlust together with, well, wanderlust, can open a literal world of adventure for
these friends.
Discovering Beauty
These types help each other make many incredible discoveries they’d never find
alone. Explorers can coax their Mediator friends from their worlds of dreams and
ideas and help them discover the sensual side of life. Mediators certainly enjoy the
artisanal qualities of beauty and craftsmanship that Explorers all possess on some
level, and they might even enjoy helping to build a fence or plant a garden, however
much Explorers may claim that these are merely chores. Mediators may appreciate
the novelty of working with their hands for once, to build something practical. Also,
time with their friends is always nice regardless of activity.
Mediators possess their own artisanal craft: the art of feeling and expression. Poetry
shared with friends can be an outlet for the intimacy Mediators seek in friendship.
With Explorers in mind, Mediators can shift their verse toward something more
colorful, something exciting and hopeful for what life and the future can bring. They
can even use their friends’ moment-to-moment outlook as inspiration for a more

immediate acknowledgment of beauty, perhaps in the form of a haiku, capturing the
timelessness of the moment as the “Gold-green light filters / Through the trees on a
shared hike / With a dear old friend.”

Unbalanced Mediator–Explorer Friendships
Contrasting Approaches
Unfortunately, the potential for these types to bond is equaled by the potential to
clash. One example is their lifestyle: Mediators are inspired by intangible values born
from their imaginations and beliefs, whereas Explorers find inspiration by connecting
to the world around them, engaging in practices rather than rumination. When either
of these types takes their own perspective too far, Mediators can become alarmed
or Explorers can become annoyed with such unbalanced behavior – or worse, they
can unfairly criticize each other’s differences.
When this happens, Mediators can be quick to judge how Explorers should feel about
things, especially in conceptual and social areas. They may think their Explorer
friends are being selfish by focusing on accomplishing their own more tangible
interests instead of sharing broader societal concerns. Explorers’ concerns and
activities often fail to contribute to societal growth, and sometimes even undermine
it. An environmentally conscious and generally considerate Mediator may fail to
appreciate the technical gains to performance their Explorer friend achieves by
removing the catalytic converter and muffler from their car – creating added
pollution and exceptional car noise in the process. In turn, Explorers who lose their
balanced perspective may get annoyed at Mediator friends for expressing highminded opinions, yet failing to follow through with any realistic ideas or practical

Friendships

action. Explorers have a great focus on personal accomplishment, and little respect
for what they may see as endless talk.
This isn’t nearly so simple as a case of altruism versus selfishness, though. Explorers
often maintain a “live and let live” attitude which at its core is highly respectful of
others. Mediators pour their energy into their ideas and creativity, but that drive can
easily become sanctimonious or guilt-based manipulation. The issue here isn’t that
one of these friends has an inferior approach, but that they can fail to respect how
well their differing approaches work. When in sync, these two balance each other
wonderfully, but if they allow their perspectives to become self-obsessed or narrow,
their differences make for a slippery slope into judgment and resentment.
Mutual Disdain for the Mundane
Fun is just what Mediators need to pull them out of the clouds, but even with the best
of intentions, these two types might step into an irresponsible dynamic. When things
go too far out of balance, they enable each other to disregard consequences.
Explorer friends are likely to encourage Mediators to set aside some of life’s
obligations, pushing them to blow off a homework assignment or loosen a budget
for a night out. For their part, Mediators easily get caught up in shared moments of
joy with friends, happily ignoring rational concerns in favor of feeling good. These
types may do little to moderate each other’s compulsions.
This may not always play out in friendships the same way it would with roommates,
families, or spouses. Nonetheless, friends can be a highly unbalanced influence on
each other when they become each other’s refuge from reality. While Mediators can
maintain priorities, those priorities can easily become unrealistic, and too much fun
indulgence with spontaneous Explorers only makes matters worse. Being supportive

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

135

of each other can do unintentional harm when these friends don’t discriminate what
they support; inspiring shared experiences can enrich the soul, while leaving bank
accounts dangerously impoverished.

Rebalancing Mediator–Explorer Friendships
Respecting Interests
Good friends often find interest in subjects they don’t care about simply because a
friend cares so much. When it comes to their different approaches to life, Mediators
and Explorers may need to be willing not only to overlook differences but also go
along for the ride occasionally. Friendship is participatory. If either type is rigid and
refuses to pay any attention to the things that excite the other, their relationship
won’t have much of a foundation.
Of course, in addition to adapting to each other’s needs, Mediators and Explorers can
have great friendships while maintaining separate interests, too. In fact, they
probably should. Friends of Explorers must appreciate their need to do their own
thing. Mediators also have their preferences, and they may need to pursue certain
things without the company of Explorers. On some level, such friendships may
require sufficient distance and flexibility to allow the individuals room to be
themselves. True friends don’t need to share everything; they can give each other
space and then rejoin to focus on making plans that are rewarding to both. These
steps can help keep both friends satisfied:
•

Try to understand each other by discussing differences.

•

Allow each other’s differences without judgment.
o Mediators could pause after their initial emotional reactions to
Explorers’ actions and step away from the situation.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

136

Friendships

o They can give themselves time to meditate on the situation, perhaps a
night to sleep on the issue, until they’re ready to consider the situation
again.
•

When friction occurs, take time apart to engage individual interests.

•

Come back together often for things that mutually enjoyable activities.

For Mediator–Explorer friendships to ultimately work, these individuals should have
enough in common, rather than simply tolerating each other’s unique pursuits.
Friendship should be a life-enhancing state filled with good times together.
Sometimes this may require friends to take an unselfish step outside of their comfort
zone or area of interest, even as they hold on to the values and interests that make
them who they are.
Looking Out for the Little Things
Mediator–Explorer friends may both want to ignore their boring responsibilities, but
because they care for each other, they should avoid becoming enablers and try to
keep a caring, watchful eye on each other’s well-being. Mutual support is a great
benefit of friendship, even if friends share similar flaws.
This can be as simple as taking a moment to ask not only what would make their
friends happy, but also what would serve them best in the long run. When facing
shared decisions about anything from life choices to recreational plans, these friends
can add a layer of respect for each other by considering each other’s welfare.
Mediators are especially good at this, and likewise deeply appreciate such efforts
from Explorer friends. These friends can run headlong into indulgence together, if
they want – they just need to avoid overshooting the target, or failing to cover their
basic duties. These friends can help each other by taking these steps:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

137

Friendships

•

Try not to distract each other from life responsibilities.

•

Keep each other’s well-being in mind when planning things together.

•

Inquire about each other’s availability based on consideration for other
priorities: “After you’re finished doing [blank], want to hang out?”

If these friends take time to observe what’s going on in each other’s lives, they’ll see
when it is or isn’t a good time to engage in fun together. Prying each other away from
stress is great, but it’s important to recognize when to let each other focus on
important things.
Accepting Non-Commitment
Explorers may be uncomfortable committing to things – not because they can’t follow
through, but because it transforms activities from joyful opportunities into
obligations. This is quite the stretch for Mediators, who value commitment.
Predictability never was the charm of these pairings, though, nor is it needed for
Mediators to feel value in their relationships. Rather, that sense of unexpected
inspiration makes Explorer friends important to Mediators who seek personal
balance. Explorers pull them into the moment, where they can see the deeper
dimensions of authenticity they seek in life.
The key is for Explorers to find a balance between surprising Mediator friends and
jerking the carpet out from under them. Mediators need consideration for their
feelings, and frankly, a little hand-holding goes a long way when leading Mediators
into changes and the unknown. Explorers can make it clear that while their interests
and direction make be subject to sudden change, their support will always be there.
Instead of turning away to follow their own path, they can offer a friendly hand and

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

138

Friendships

the option to join, as this helps Mediators feel valued and respected whether they
choose to participate or not.
Mediators care about their friends, and to create balanced friendships with
Explorers, they can work to accept their unique qualities and needs: The stricter the
arrangement, the less likely Explorers are to be comfortable. Any efforts to control
or direct them – something Mediators may want to do in reaction to Explorers’
spontaneity – is likely to push them away. Mediators can moderate their desire for
promises and commitment with appreciation for Explorers’ spontaneity and how it
can benefit them. Such friends will be ready to drop what they’re doing and join them
at a moment’s notice. Here are some steps these friends can take to ensure their
relationship is balanced:
•

Be gently honest with each other when something isn’t fun anymore.

•

Be understanding when one of you wants a change.

•

Try to manage expectations internally, and be flexible.

•

When something’s important, ask for – and give – the best effort to stick with
it together.

Early and frequent communication can help Mediators and Explorers manage
changing preferences between them. There’s no better method than staying kind
and considerate toward each other, yet honest about changing individual needs.

Conclusion
Mediators are known for their never-ending quest to put things together in
wonderful ways, and when it comes to friendship, this dance takes on a new
dimension by incorporating the unique qualities and needs of other personality

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

139

Friendships

types. Mediators want to forge lasting relationships with people who share their
values and perspectives. When these types open themselves to people that aren’t
immediately compatibility, or who challenge a Mediator’s typical way of think, they’ll
find ways to grow through their friendship.
Mediators’ combination of traits makes them passionately progressive, but not
always open-minded; they have deep values and a tendency to see the world in a
hopeful light that can fail to account for a sometimes unfortunate or unfair reality.
Friendships with people who don’t completely share their perspective might not
provide obvious reassurance, but ultimately, they may present even greater insights.
Personal growth is about creating new understanding, and it can’t always be
comfortable: similar-minded people may not give Mediators the chance to achieve
their greatest potential.
On the other hand, friendship shouldn’t feel like a lesson to be learned, always
challenging the mind to expand. Everyone craves the comfort of trustworthy friends
with whom they can share their deepest secrets, people who will stick with them
through thick and thin. Yet it’s important that at least some friends are simply fun
and relaxing.
Fortunately for Mediators, personality types who are very different from their own
can provide such comforts. Regardless of people’s differing methods and
perspectives, Mediators can almost always find something to appreciate and admire
about other types. These types want to see the best in people. When Mediators
follow their desire for connection into unexpected friendships, the rewards often
exceed expectations.

Few challenges in life are so exhausting, yet so rewarding, as parenting, and
Mediators are undoubtedly up for the challenge. These types bring the same amount
of enthusiasm to their roles as parents as they do to their most passionate ideals.
Mediators strike an impressive balance of gentle authority and inspirational
companionship with their kids.
Mediator parents have several qualities that make them ideal guides, especially in
how they relate to and encourage their kids. Their ability to both articulate their
values and demonstrate the importance of developing a personal belief system is
inspiring to wide-eyed, idealistic youth. These types often relate to their children in a
magical, child-like way. This chapter describes strengths that can be embraced, and
areas that can be focused on, to help Mediator parents maintain or regain balance
as they help their children grow.
Compassionate and Supportive
Where others are quick to dismiss the complaints of their tiny progeny, Mediator
parents take pains to make sure their children feel heard. Whether talking their

141

Parenthood

toddlers through their first boo-boos in need of a Band-Aid, or helping teenagers
overcome their first broken hearts, they’ve a steady supply of shoulders to cry on.
Whatever their children’s temperament and circumstance, these types meet them as
they are with open hearts. Not that their sons and daughters are the only
beneficiaries of Mediators’ kindness – these parents care for all creatures great and
small, a quality that’s sure to make an impact on any impressionable minds in their
homes. Weaving respect for all life and all minds into their children’s growing psyches,
Mediators extend their compassion and kindness into their children’s fundamental
worldview, creating empathic, understanding adults who carry these values forward.
In addition to being compassionate, these types are patiently supportive of their
children. Rather than pushing their kids in the directions they choose for them or
chastising them for having unrealistic goals, Mediator parents are the strong, steady
wind at their children’s backs, and are quick to shift if their kids decide they’d like to
take a different route. Where some adults become frustrated at their children’s
stubbornness, Mediators understand that kids often act out in frustration at their
inability to meet their needs, or even communicate these needs to those around
them. The extra time their children might need to overcome obstacles is time that
Mediator parents grant with gentle patience.
Moral and Modest
Like all Diplomat parents, Mediators focus intently on morality. Rather than
emphasizing rigid rules of etiquette to abide by, however, Mediators prefer to
sincerely convey, through stories and meaningful conversations, the moral behavior
they wish to pass on. These parents encourage their kids to listen to their emotions
when making decisions, and not to be afraid of being sensitive and kind wherever
possible. Having their children grow up as empathetic yet principled individuals is a

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

142

Parenthood

key goal for parents with the Mediator personality type. At the same time, they
respect the uniqueness of each individual and don’t necessarily believe that any way
of thinking is more “correct” than any other. As passionate as they are about their
personal beliefs, they’re equally respectful of other people’s beliefs, so long as they
benefit humanity.
Promoting morality is important, but in the minds of Mediators, there isn’t one
specific way that it must be done. Their modesty and open-mindedness prevent
these parents from enforcing a strictly dogmatic method of moral behavior, leaving
their children the option to find a system of embracing and promoting their morals
and ideals that works best for them. This approach has the added benefit of
encouraging kids to respect and appreciate the diverse methods that others use to
develop their own morality, rather than viewing these differences as “right or wrong.”
Unstructured
While they can be downright transcendent when engaging with their children in the
emotional, moral, and spiritual realms, Mediators often find themselves struggling in
the earthly dimension that includes life’s day-to-day mundanities. Structure doesn’t
come easily to these parents, who have a hard time understanding the values of
consistency, details, and routine, prizing instead openness and possibility. However,
for young children who are only beginning to grasp the complexities of the world
around them, rules and schedules provide a comforting predictability to life’s
otherwise unfamiliar chaos. They also ensure they’re on time for the things they care
about, and that small promises are kept.
Though freedom-loving Mediator parents may feel that open bedtimes and early
sovereignty are ways of freeing their children from the artificial restrictions they rebel

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

143

Parenthood

against, they’d do well to remember that kids don’t understand how to use such
freedom responsibly. Some mistakes can only be made once, and children depend
on the wisdom of others. It can be helpful for Mediators who struggle with structure
to have parenting partners who balance them out in this regard, but this isn’t always
possible. Without an effort to mitigate this – with calendars, sticky notes, or whatever
else they need to do to keep track of responsibilities – their kids can struggle to
develop necessary responsible behaviors.
Overly Sensitive
Their sensitivity and focus on morality mean that things other personality types
would probably shrug off may hurt emotionally vulnerable Mediators deeply. Few
things cause more anguish to these types than seeing their sincere beliefs about
what is right and noble challenged or rejected by their children. In such
circumstances, less confident parents can turn inwards, blaming themselves and
becoming consumed with guilt for being unable to instill the right values. These types
tend to be forgiving to all but themselves.
Parents with this personality type should be especially careful with their feelings
during their children’s adolescent years. Teenagers often rebel against their parents’
authority as a natural part of their growing independence and identity development.
Unlike their younger years, rebellion at this stage is much more intimidating with the
addition of raw emotions, higher intellect, and aggressive desire. Mediators shouldn’t
immediately assume that their teens are actively fighting their beliefs, or that all their
teachings were ignored. Conflict is no indication that a relationship is in jeopardy,
and for many types it’s a sign of trust – for kids to express their feelings to their
parents is no small act. Yet Mediators who allow themselves to feel deeply hurt may

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

144

Parenthood

try to focus all their efforts on mitigating damage and strengthening their
relationships with their teenagers, provoking even stronger pushback.
Creating Structure and Rhythm
Perhaps one of the most beneficial things that these parents can do to build
meaningful balance is to incorporate structure and rhythm in their kids’ daily lives.
Besides reducing stress and chaos, routines have the added benefit of providing
stability for children, effectively decreasing the likelihood of mood swings and
emotional outbursts.
While such creative types may balk at the idea of “structure” – equating that word
with boredom and conformity – the truth is, when used correctly, structure can
provide more freedom to create and connect with their children. The adage, “In limits,
there is freedom,” holds true for kids of all personality types who rely on their parents
to set safe boundaries they can count on.
There are several specific ways that Mediator parents can create a rhythm and
accountability system that benefits both themselves and their kids. Preparing for
each day the night before – laying out outfits, tidying up the kitchen, making lunches,
etc. – can make mornings less chaotic. Writing things down on a calendar, planner,
or online scheduling app (that can be shared with their children as they get older) is
another technique that’s especially beneficial for sometimes scattered Mediators.
Using timers and setting reminders can help to avoid last-minute rushes or forgotten
appointments. Finally, these freedom-loving parents can also benefit from leaving
room for spontaneity in each day and keeping their schedules simple and balanced.
If they can prevent falling prey to society’s pressure to overschedule their children in
a multitude of activities, both Mediators and their kids can thrive.

145

Parenthood

Practicing Self-Compassion
Creating strong, empathic parent-child relationships is one of Mediators’ top
priorities. Even perceived rejection or indifference from their sons and daughters can
be heartbreaking for these sensitive individuals. Rejection, both real and perceived,
is inevitable when raising children, and Mediators need to prepare themselves to
deal with these situations in a healthy way.
Empathy can be both a blessing and a curse when dealing with stressful situations.
While they can use their empathy in an outward manner, sharing in the feelings of
those around them, these types can struggle with understanding their own feelings.
When stressed, they may deprive themselves of personal compassion, exacerbating
their feelings of rejection and isolation.
There are options for those who want to parent from a place of passion rather than
one of fear of failure or rejection. Engaging walks in nature provide Mediators a
much-needed respite from the negative rumination they may be caught up in. Also,
writing down their unfiltered thoughts and feelings can be incredibly cathartic for
these types. (It’s helpful to reflect on the transience of feelings when writing – what
may be hurtful or frustrating now will inevitably change.) Burning or throwing away
the words they’ve written can also symbolically “get rid” of negative thoughts or
feelings. Centering activities such as meditation, prayer, and even deep breathing
can be beneficial even in short five to 15-minute durations. When they’re feeling
particularly confused by their emotions, Mediators should seek out trusted friends
or family members to share their feelings with. What may feel like a tangled mess of
thoughts and emotions can be sorted through with the help of loving confidants.

Stages of Development
Each of the stages children’s growth present both unique challenges and exciting
milestones. Learning how to navigate these stages can seem daunting, but the
opportunity to build healthy attachment and create meaningful memories makes it
worth the struggle.
Renowned psychologist Erik Erikson proposed a theory of psychosocial development
that identified eight stages, five of which take place between birth and 18 years of
age. It’s important to remember that these stages aren’t set in stone and the ages
listed for each stage are approximate. Kids develop at their own pace and meet each
milestone in their own time.
The following paragraphs discuss what to expect at each stage of development, as
well as how the strengths and weaknesses of the Mediator personality type affects
their parenting at each stage. We then offer suggestions on how to help Mediators
turn an unbalanced approach around. Whatever the stages of development, growth
never stops.

Building Bonds (From Birth to Approximately 1 ½
Years)
According to Erikson, the stages of infancy and early childhood last from birth until
approximately three years of age. Children in these stages are very dependent on
their parents to meet their needs. This is also when the bonds of attachment are
created by meeting their children’s needs, developing trusting relationships, and
promoting autonomy.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

147

Parenthood

The priority for infants in their journey to attachment is having their basic needs met.
From being fed to receiving affection, babies need to learn to trust that their
Mediator parents can provide for them. If these types are inconsistent in providing
for their infants, their children can have difficulty creating positive, trusting
attachment.
Attentive and affectionate Mediators – especially those who engage in consistent
physical contact such as snuggling or transporting their children in baby carriers on
their bodies – can develop trusting, hopeful relationships with their infants and are
likely to have little difficulty building comfortable attachment.

Balanced Infant Bonding
Building Loving Bonds
Mediators who tap into their empathy and sensitivity when their babies are born
have no trouble giving their infants the attention and affection needed to build loving
bonds. Infants need affection that goes beyond just daily care. They crave the
physical connection that their parents provide through cuddling, rocking, speaking
softly, and making eye contact. Mediators’ loving smiles do more than just entertain
their babies – they create a primal connection that inspires the trust needed to create
positive relationships.
In addition to affection and compassion, dedication is necessary for building trusting
relationships with infants. Mediator parents are extraordinarily passionate
individuals, and there’s very little that they’re more passionate about than their
children. From the moment that their children are born, these types throw all their
energy into making sure that their babies’ needs are met, both physically and

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

148

Parenthood

emotionally. Building trusting, loving bonds with their infants comes naturally to
individuals with this personality type.
Open to Anything
While structure and schedules are certainly important during the infancy stage,
flexibility and the ability to quickly adapt to changing needs is just as important.
Midnight feedings, spontaneous crying fits, and unexpected diaper disasters are just
a few of the ways that babies refuse to adhere to a schedule. Thankfully, Mediators
are exceptionally flexible, and find it relatively easy to readjust their expectations
when situations change unexpectedly.
Caring for infants is exhausting. However, Mediator parents certainly appreciate the
many new experiences that this stage provides – albeit maybe not until after they’ve
recovered from their sleep deprivation. Nothing bores them more than a strict,
unchanging schedule day in and day out, and they certainly won’t have to worry
about that with their new babies. While not all interruptions to their schedules are
pleasant, they’re enough to keep these parents on their toes and prevent boredom.

Unbalanced Infant Bonding
Neglectful of Their Own Needs
One of the less beneficial results of their passionate parenting is the tendency for
Mediators to become so absorbed in caring for their infants that they forget to take
care of their own basic needs. Eating and sleeping can take a back seat to engaging
with their newborns. Neglecting their needs to this extent can lead to health issues,
both physically and mentally, if they begin to suffer from burnout and unhealthy
eating, exercise, and social habits.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

149

Parenthood

This imbalance is more likely to happen when these types aren’t receiving support
from their partners, families, or friends, who can both assist with child care and
encourage them to take some much-needed time to care for themselves. These
situations can become dire when a combined lack of support and self-care cause
resentment and animosity in their relationships with others. Friends and family may
feel completely neglected by Mediators in this state, while their partners may bear
the brunt of their frustration and exhaustion. Feeling like mere ghosts of their true
selves, parents with this personality type may run out of the emotional reserves
necessary to nurture their connections with others.
From Dreams to Diapers
Many Mediators have a very idealized vision of what parenting infants should be like.
Visions of sweet lullaby sessions in a cozy rocking chair and cooing over a smiling
baby splashing in the tub are inevitably doused by the reality of all-night crying
sessions and mountains of dirty diapers. This wake-up call can be especially shocking
to dreamy parents who are unprepared for the massive responsibility placed before
them.
Dreams of basking in the magical moments of infancy are eventually met with reality
– parents are responsible for providing for their kids in an emotional way, and they
must meet their children’s practical needs as well. Achieving this level of security and
stability can seem elusive to any new parents, and inexperienced Mediator parents
may find the adjustment especially difficult.

Rebalancing Infant Bonding
Prioritize Self-Care
Learning to balance their needs with those of their children is one of the most
important things Mediators can do. Taking a thirty-minute bath while their partners
put the kids to bed can help these types relax. Taking relatives up on their offers to
baby-sit can provide much-needed time to meet with friends for coffee. Even
engaging in deep breathing exercises for five minutes can help to clear their minds
and relax their bodies.
Additionally, all the relationships Mediator have prior to bringing their infants home
undoubtedly go through a period of readjustment. It’s vital for these types’ overall
well-being to make sure that they make their connections with others, especially
spouses or partners, a priority so they don’t alienate their support system. One
simple way Mediators can engage with their partners or other close friends and
family members who play a significant role in their lives is to begin a gratitude
practice. This can be done in a few minutes at any time during the day with the
following steps:
•

Choosing a regular time each day – first thing in the morning, at supper, before
bed – when they can communicate with each other face to face.

•

Taking turns listing three things that they’re grateful for about their spouses,
then listing three things that they’re grateful for about that day.

•

Discussing one thing that’s bothering them that day. Avoid statements like,
“My partner is the one thing bothering me” – these can easily negate all the
positive things just listed.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

151

Parenthood

Being vulnerable and expressing gratitude are both practices that promote intimacy
between partners, which is vitally important to Mediators who crave understanding
and connection. The healthier their relationships are with their partners, and the
stronger their network of support, the better parents Mediators can be for their
children.
Finding Beauty in the Mundane
It’s easy to see the beauty in those moments where babies are sleeping peacefully or
smiling lovingly at their parents. However, beauty doesn’t suffice in those moments
when their infants won’t stop crying or when the laundry is piled up so high it
resembles a geological formation. Most people would advise these types to just “deal
with it,” because parenthood is hard and not always lovely and magical. These types
of reality checks can further frustrate already disenchanted Mediators. A more
effective (and enjoyable) approach to this problem is to purposely look for the beauty
even in the most mundane moments.
Wabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that can be summarized as finding beauty in
imperfection. Think of a handmade coffee mug, with its lack of symmetry and minor
faults – part of the appeal of this item is that it’s imperfect and has its own character
and uniqueness. Rather than focusing on the stresses of keeping their home clean
or dealing with a crabby baby, Mediators can use this concept to embrace these
difficult moments and find the beauty within them.
The following steps can help develop a meditation or gratitude practice when dealing
with the mundanity of parenthood:
•

Choosing a mantra that promotes peace or gratitude, such as, “I am thankful
for this day,” or, “Today I choose happiness.”

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

152

Parenthood

•

Repeating this mantra when doing any tasks that seem tedious or frustrating,
like rocking the baby back to sleep in the middle of the night… for the third
time.

•

Practicing countering negative thoughts, such as, “I’m going to lose my damn
mind if I have to change another dirty diaper,” into positive statements, such
as, “I am grateful for this opportunity to spend time with my child.”

Parenting is hard – often the hardest part of a person’s life is raising another. And it’s
often discouraging, especially during those years where children are unable (and
sometimes unwilling) to express gratitude or reciprocate affection. Rather than
succumbing to disappointment when their dream of parenthood doesn’t match
reality, Mediators can embrace this opportunity for what it is – a chance to experience
an incredibly beautiful and fulfilling relationship.

Testing Boundaries (From Approximately 1 ½ to 3
Years)
Once they’re mobile, young children become very interested in exploring their
environment with their senses. Crawling, walking, grabbing items, putting things in
their mouth, and verbal communication are just a few of the ways that toddlers learn
about the world around them.
During this stage, Mediator parents must provide safe harbor for their toddlers while
still allowing them to experience and explore their surroundings. Kids who test
boundaries, yet still receive parental support and encouragement, develop a sense
of autonomy. Children who are overly restricted, criticized, or made to feel guilty for
their desire to test boundaries ultimately experience a sense of shame and may

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Parenthood

suffer from feelings of incompetence or low self-worth. These feelings can last
throughout their lives, and may ultimately jeopardize their ability to achieve goals
and develop positive character traits such as reliability or confidence.

Balanced Toddler Bonding
Trustworthy and Compassionate
Extremely supportive, Mediators make an ideal “home base” for their sons and
daughters during this stage. Their engagement and determination to meet their
toddlers’ needs ensure that their little ones never feel abandoned, ignored, or
unloved. Even though children at this age are incredibly independent, they still crave
(and need) trustworthy caregivers, and these types don’t disappoint.
Mediators’ patient compassion is especially useful during the trying toddler years.
While they can certainly be challenging, confident Mediator parents enjoy promoting
their children’s curiosity and independence while still maintaining a safe
environment. They take pleasure in helping their toddlers learn how to pick out their
own clothes and dress themselves, and promoting their children’s natural creativity
and self-expression. Helping their children learn to become creative, self-reliant, and
competent are among Mediator parents’ greatest joys.
Relatable and Respectful
If Mediators relate with greater ease than most to children – toddlers included – it’s
because they see the world through the same fresh eyes, and appreciate how
sincerely and authentically children interact with the world around them. These
parents appreciate their children’s struggles in a way that few other adults
understand, with an empathetic connection that facilitates honest, open

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

154

Parenthood

communication. Due to their quiet, unassuming nature, many Mediators experience
situations where they feel marginalized and misunderstood (flashback to feeling
invisible at a restaurant or throughout all high school), making it easier to relate to
the frustration and helplessness their kids may feel. This understanding makes these
parents more likely than most to treat their children’s requests – as well as grievances
– with the utmost respect.
Relating to their sons and daughters in such a meaningful way is certainly nice, but
is of little help when it comes to dealing with disobedience. Experienced Mediator
parents work toward finding a balance between understanding the reason for their
children’s behavior while still enforcing the values they want their kids to uphold.
They may realize their toddlers’ temper tantrums are due to missing nap time, but
that won’t result in legitimizing unacceptable conduct – especially if it repeatedly
manifests as violence or disrespectful behavior. Clearly, values and morality aren’t
fully developed in children at this stage. That doesn’t stop Mediators from
consistently and gently reinforcing the behaviors they want to pass on to their tiny
progeny.

Unbalanced Toddler Bonding
Taking Things Personally
This stage can be especially challenging for Mediator parents if they take their
toddlers’ willful or defiant behavior personally. When the children they’ve so lovingly
raised begin using their newly acquired favorite word (“No!”) in response to their
parents’ questions, it can be both frustrating and discouraging. From throwing a fit
every evening at bedtime to refusing to eat any form of fresh produce (or any healthy

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

155

Parenthood

food for that matter), toddlers often seem as though they’re focused on challenging
what their parents have taught them at every turn.
As much as they truly want to foster their children’s independence, Mediators
struggle when their children’s behavior doesn’t match their expectations. The toddler
stage is where identity development begins, and kids are rarely going to behave in a
way that fits their parents’ personal mold. Behaviors such as hitting their siblings or
yelling at their parents – which, while not desirable, are normal for this stage – can
be especially demoralizing to Mediators who feel their children’s moral development
should be further along at this point. When these parents are more focused on these
idealized versions of their children, they may miss opportunities to promote and
support what’s unique about their toddlers.
Too Permissive
Toddlers are professional boundary pushers, and Mediators crave harmony. Clearly
these two mentalities are diametrically opposed, which can result in overwhelmed
parents and domineering children. Rather than dealing with constant battles and
temper tantrums, disheartened Mediators may find themselves caving into their
toddlers’ demands for more screen time or extra snacks.
Harmony is certainly valuable, but it isn’t what permissive parents are creating when
they consistently give in to their children’s demands. Rather, they’re telling their
toddlers that if they just hold out long enough, they’ll eventually get whatever they
want. In addition to giving into their demands, permissive parents often fail to
consistently enforce rules or consequences for unacceptable behavior. While they
may believe they’re providing freedom and friendship rather than restrictive rules,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

156

Parenthood

Mediator parents who fail to uphold necessary boundaries are setting their children
up for potential behavior issues, a lack of ambition, and poor decision-making skills.

Rebalancing Toddler Bonding
Promoting Responsible Independence
Pushing boundaries and defiant behavior are hallmarks of this stage, and while they
can be extraordinarily frustrating, they’re necessary parts of developing autonomy.
Saying “no” is a way to establish boundaries, and developing boundaries is a
fundamental component to identity development. It’s easy to respond emotionally
in such trying circumstances. However, that’s not only unproductive, but often
exacerbates the situation. Mediator parents must take time to understand their kids
are establishing autonomy and aren’t intentionally looking to reject them. Once they
change their mindset to one of understanding over frustration, these types can have
more success in setting boundaries with their children.
Just because children are learning to set their own boundaries, it doesn’t mean their
parents should allow them to get away with demanding behavior. Rather,
understanding why their little ones are acting in this manner can prevent some of the
Mediators’ negative reactionary responses. Here are some ways Mediator parents
can approach potentially frustrating experiences (such as leaving the park) in a
proactive rather than reactive manner:
•

Upon arriving at the park, letting toddlers know how long they’ll be there.

•

Starting the countdown at least 15 minutes before leaving.

•

Announcing the time left in five-minute increments. (“We are leaving in 15
minutes… Ten minutes left before we leave… Ok, five minutes left.”)

•

Making sure toddlers hear the warnings, and making eye contact with them

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

157

Parenthood

when possible.
•

Walking calmly toward children when there’s about one minute left.

•

Avoiding the temptation to rush or leave quickly if possible. The more positive
the experience, the more likely toddlers are to leave willingly in the future.

This process allows kids to complete any activities and ensures they understand their
parents’ expectations. It also gives Mediators a sense of control – a way to be
proactive and prevent temper tantrums – rather than just reacting to these outbursts
with their own emotional responses.
Supporting with Structure and Discipline
There’s nothing inherently wrong with Mediators wanting their kids to like them, or
in promoting freedom and independence from a young age. Problems arise when
armony and independence are prioritized above their children’s need for structure
and discipline. Toddlers are incapable of understanding the consequences of their
behavior, especially when their parents fail to explain or enforce household rules.
Thankfully, it’s possible for Mediators to maintain a loving bond with their kids while
still providing the boundaries necessary to make sure they’re safe and well-behaved.
Perhaps the most important thing for these parents to understand is that restricting
their children’s freedom when they’re young teaches them how to be responsible
with higher levels of freedom when they’re older. Children who have never had to
regulate their behavior or be accountable for their actions are more likely to engage
in risky behaviors and take advantage of their freedom. Kids who gradually earn their
independence, on the other hand, have greater self-control and a much better
understanding of the potential consequences of their behavior since they’ve been
disciplined in the past. Here’s several steps Mediator parents can take to provide the

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

158

Parenthood

structure and discipline their toddlers both need and desire to set them up for the
most successful future possible:
•

Making sure household expectations and rules are well known to all members
of the family.

•

Being consistent in enforcing rules and making sure children know the
consequences of breaking these rules.

•

Rewarding positive behaviors with special privileges or treats.

•

Enlisting spouses, partners, family members, or close friends to be
accountability partners and to assist when situations are overwhelming.

Thirst for Knowledge (From Approximately 3 to 5
Years)
The preschool years, from approximately three to five years of age, are a prime time
for brain development, and children at this stage accumulate knowledge at an
extraordinary rate. Kids absorb information like sponges through constant activity
and a seemingly infinite range of questions. Learning at this stage takes place
through play (especially the unstructured kind), and lots of social interaction with
family and peers. Creativity is also exercised extensively through imaginary play and
make-believe games and stories.
To master this stage, preschoolers must be given the opportunity to not only make
some of their own decisions, but also be allowed to initiate activities, ask questions –
and receive answers – and lead others in exploration play. Children who aren’t given
these opportunities, or are made to feel as though their constant questions or
childish make-believe games are annoying, can experience feelings of guilt,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

159

Parenthood

frustration, and a lack of competence. Consequently, they may suffer from poor selfcontrol or a lack of initiative.

Balanced Preschool Relationships
Natural Teachers
As promoters of lifelong learning themselves, Mediator parents genuinely look
forward to inspiring their sons and daughters to enjoy learning as well. They happily
answer their preschool children’s seemingly ceaseless stream of questions, and take
great pleasure in finding creative ways to engage their kids in learning opportunities.
From trips to the library to impromptu nature “classes” while walking to the park,
these types take any chance they can to engage with and inspire their little ones.
Seeking out educational opportunities isn’t the only form of teaching that Mediator
parents engage in. Modeling morals and values for their children from a young age
is just as important to them as any other form of learning. These parents teach their
children to not only respect others, but also appreciate their differences as well.
Compassion is key with these types, and they’ll go out of their way, quite literally, to
model this behavior for their kids – like pulling over to help a stray or hurt animal,
even if they’re already running late to school. Preschoolers can likely not only witness
their parents’ actions, but also be involved in helping (in age-appropriate ways) with
caring for any plants, animals, or people that need their help.
Emotionally Engaged
Life with their preschoolers isn’t only about “teachable moments” for Mediator
parents. Emotional engagement is their number one priority, both in terms of
building strong bonds with their children and in teaching them how to develop their

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

160

Parenthood

emotional intelligence. Self-control, empathy, and interpersonal relationships
(especially with peers) are all beginning to develop, and kids at this stage must have
guidance to properly develop these skills.
Emotional intelligence is best learned through modeling, and this is where these
parents can truly shine. There are few types who engage with others as authentically
as Mediators. They’re full of love and compassion for others and instinctually model
these concepts to their children. Imaginary play is an especially useful outlet for
practicing these skills. Something as simple as playing a game of “house” with their
kids can be a perfect opportunity for them to both model healthy relationships and
lovingly redirect less-than-desirable behaviors. Not only do they pass on their
emotional wisdom, parents who engage in these types of play with their preschoolers
enhance their emotional bonds as well.

Unbalanced Preschool Relationships
Prone to Burnout
The preschool years bring a new level of energy with them as children become more
interested in making sense of the world around them. Kids at this stage are more
mobile and opinionated than ever, which can try the patience of even the most
devoted caregivers. Parenting is an exhausting endeavor, and this stage can be
especially draining with kids’ constant questions and need for stimulation. As an
Introverted and especially private personality type, Mediators who fail to set up
boundaries or find time to recharge quickly become depleted by the constant
attention that their children demand.
Children aren’t the only ones placing excessive expectations on parents at this stage.
The preschool era ushers in an increasing number of play dates, swimming lesson,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

161

Parenthood

and art classes. In today’s increasingly connected culture, there’s an often-unrealistic
expectation that parents should be shuttling their children to every enrichment
opportunity available and documenting it all on social media. Mediator parents who
feel pressured to play into society’s expectations can become overwhelmed, feeling
the need to make every birthday party and family vacation worthy of “sharing.” All
this running around and attempting to be “perfect parents” can quickly take a toll on
these types, who would much prefer to focus on the meaningful over the marketable.
Struggling with Schedules
The same issues that can lead to burnout for Mediator parents are often the root
cause of the schedule-anxiety that they’re apt to succumb to during this stage. The
preschool years often bring with them an exponential increase in activities and
expectations. Preschool classes, play dates, birthday parties, and community events
geared toward children appear in excess as parents are expected to become more
interested in educating and entertaining their children outside of the home. For
Mediators, who abhor schedules and can struggle with making plans or being on
time, this stage can truly test their limits.
As a Prospecting type, Mediators prefer freedom over itineraries. This laid-back
mentality can spiral into irresponsible behaviors, especially for those who are less
mature, resulting in their children being consistently late to classes or play dates.
Tardiness, forgetting appointments and playdates, and failing to provide the funds
for classes or field trips is a recipe for constant stress and frustration. While they
certainly don’t need to sign up to play chauffer for every class event or bring snacks
to all the soccer games, these parents shouldn’t assume that they can get by with
frequent unreliability. If they fail to organize their lives in a way that works for both

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

162

Parenthood

their sanity and their preschoolers’ social calendars, Mediators may find themselves
living in constant chaos.

Rebalancing Preschool Relationships
Re-Adjusting Expectations
Rather than allowing their own and society’s expectations to drive them to the brink
of burnout, Mediator parents can learn to say “no” to the endless play dates and
parties and say “yes” to taking a much-needed break whenever possible. Kids benefit
more from having healthy, happy parents than they do from having birthday parties
with designer cakes, pony rides, and goody bags worthy of being handed out at the
Oscars. And these types benefit more from focusing on meeting both their children’s
and their own needs in authentic ways rather than buckling to societal expectations.
While Mediator parents may initially feel some guilt for not “living up” to these oftenunrealistic expectations, they ultimately feel liberated from the unnecessary
obligations. It’s also important for them to find ways to take care of themselves amid
parenting their preschoolers. Some ideas that can bring balance into this busy stage
include:
•

Determining the number of activities that feel right – one play date per week
is fine and so is four, whatever works best for both parents and their children.

•

Learning to say “No.” While birthday parties and nature classes are nice, having
a relaxing weekend or afternoon is sometimes more important.

•

Knowing the signs of burnout and exhaustion for both parents and children,
which can include:
o Temper tantrums and spontaneous tears.
o Extreme tiredness.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

163

Parenthood

o Feelings of anxiety or trepidation when certain events are on the
horizon.
•

Starting small – trying one class or play group for a couple of weeks to see if it
feels right.

•

Avoiding the temptation to try to do too many things at once.

•

Avoiding letting others inflict guilty for not participating in every little thing.
Focusing on Sanity

There’s nothing quite like parenthood to make Mediators aware of some of their
most frustrating flaws. Scheduling, organization, and details in general can allude
many of these types, and it’s important for their sanity to figure out how to deal with
these issues once kids enter the picture. While words like “structure” and “planning”
can sound like torture to a personality type that thrives on flexibility, they can find
that building a daily rhythm into their lives provides them with more freedom.
Many Mediators, especially those who are parents, fail to take the time they need to
recharge their Introverted batteries. A daily rhythm can provide the structure
necessary to make sure that everyone’s needs are being met while also ensuring that
important tasks are being attended to. This rhythm can also create a sense of control,
providing these parents with a reprieve from feelings of perpetual chaos that are a
constant source of stress and distraction. The following tips can help them create a
daily rhythm to help find sanity amid the bedlam of parenthood:
•

First, and most importantly, determining daily priorities that must be
considered every day, such as alone time, family time, exercise, or time for
engaging in hobbies.

•

Utilizing scheduling tools to help organize these priorities, such as an online

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

164

Parenthood

calendar, a bullet journal, a day planner, or even a large family calendar
hanging in the kitchen or family room.
•

When creating a schedule for the day, making sure to include periods of time
with nothing scheduled – this allows for flexibility.

•

Figuring out a rhythm that works best and committing to following that rhythm
for at least 28 days so that it evolves into a habit.

Creating Competence (From Approximately 5 to 12
Years)
The early school years are an important period of skill development for young
children. Not only are they still constantly absorbing new information, they’re also
working on becoming proficient in increasingly complex areas, from relationships to
mathematics to athletics. Children who are both challenged and supported in these
areas flourish in both their abilities as well as their self-confidence.
If they don’t receive consistent support, kids at this stage can begin to feel inferior to
their peers, and are less likely to develop and work toward long-term goals. On the
other hand, if they aren’t sufficiently challenged, they can begin to feel overlyconfident in themselves and their abilities and come to lack modesty and
compassion toward others. They can also have difficulty coping with the inevitable
failures they’ll face.

165

Parenthood

Balanced School-Age Relationships
Passionate and Encouraging
Often avid learners themselves, Mediators encourage their sons and daughters to
pursue their education with passion and curiosity. Passing spelling tests and
memorizing multiplication tables aren’t as important to these types as having kids
who are creative and compassionate. If they feel their children aren’t receiving a truly
holistic education, these parents can explore alternative options such as
homeschooling or charter schools to fill in the gaps.
Their empathic nature helps Mediators to quickly realize when their children may be
struggling, allowing them to step in and offer their support before these situations
get too serious. Their encouragement extends beyond academics, with support for
their children’s social and personal development as well. Knowing the challenges
their children are facing, these parents provide them with the tools necessary, such
as empathy and compassion, to help them deal with difficult peers or frustrating
fights with friends.
Spiritual and Emotional Mentors
The school years are a time of intense learning, not just academically but emotionally,
spiritually and socially as well. Mature Mediators excel at modeling the skills needed
to be compassionate, considerate, and motivated individuals. Yes, children need to
learn mathematics and writing, but if their education fails to incorporate human
elements like spiritual and emotional needs, they ultimately end up confused and
unfulfilled. Parents with this personality type go out of their way to ensure that their
children find meaning in everything they do. They encourage them to pursue

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

166

Parenthood

passions that focus on innovation and creativity over the rote memorization that’s
often expected at this stage.
At a stage in life when kids are constantly being told what to do and required to
conform to strict schedules, innovation and creativity often become neglected or
viewed as unnecessary. Imaginative Mediator parents encourage their kids to
incorporate their unique ideas and perspectives into both their academic and
personal lives. They encourage their sons and daughters to integrate their passions
and causes into these areas as well – from science projects focused on solving issues
surrounding global warming to organizing a student council community volunteer
day. Few types are as effective at inspiring and promoting passion into their children
at this stage as Mediators.

Unbalanced School-Age Relationships
Struggle with Confidence
One of the most important skills for kids to develop during their school years is
confidence. From persisting on a difficult school assignment to standing up for a
friend who is being teased, confidence is what gives children the strength to work
hard and do the right thing. Mediator parents who may have lacked support or
encouragement during their formative years are especially likely to lack confidence
in their own abilities. Struggling in a school setting or being belittled by domineering
parents or teachers may come back to haunt these types, preventing them from
developing – and therefore modeling – the confidence necessary to thrive.
If they fail to overcome these barriers themselves, Mediator parents run the risk of
raising children who shut down in the face of adversity. It does little good to tell a
child to, “Stand up for what they believe in,” and to “Persevere when the going gets

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

167

Parenthood

tough,” if they fail to model these behaviors in their own lives. Their kids won’t only
struggle with their own confidence, but may see their well-intentioned parents as
hypocrites that fail to “walk the walk” when things become too challenging.
Overly Idealistic
Mediators’ passionate idealism can cause issues for their children at this stage if it
isn’t properly balanced with their children’s needs and abilities. School-aged kids
certainly benefit from being concerned about protecting the environment and
practicing compassion toward all living things. However, they also need parents who
can help them address some of the practical issues they may face daily. From a
school crush that isn’t reciprocated to the trauma of being picked last for the kickball
team, children at this age need parents who can help them deal with personal issues
that deeply affect them.
If they’re constantly focused on the bigger picture, Mediator parents can fail to
validate their children’s feelings on these “smaller issues” and find their kids are less
likely to seek their help or support in the future. Sure, the world isn’t going to end if
their children don’t make the basketball team, but it can feel catastrophic to children
at that age, when everything that happens to them is a big deal. Parents who don’t
recognize this and don’t help their children put things into perspective can ultimately
struggle to maintain close relationships with them.

Rebalancing School-Age Relationships
Promote Confidence
The beauty of confidence is it’s a skill that can be developed at any age – it’s never
too late to improve this trait. Parenthood is a very effective motivator, and Mediator

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

168

Parenthood

parents have every desire to help their kids be successful in life. Individuals with this
personality type are put off by self-promotion and any behavior they view as selfserving, and must overcome their misguided belief that being confident somehow
equates as being arrogant.
Mediators can also keep in mind how important it is for their school-aged children to
develop a sense of competence to effectively move through this stage. Children
should be encouraged to take pride in their work and be taught to view failures as
new opportunities. They thrive when their parents acknowledge their achievements
and learn that their hard work can pay off. Hang spelling tests they ace on the
refrigerator, and celebrate with extra desert after dinner or a (slightly) later bedtime
that weekend.
When they fail, Mediator parents can help them dust themselves off and look for the
light at the end of that proverbial tunnel. Didn’t make the dance team? That’s fine –
they can join cheerleading or debate instead! Kids who realizes that failure isn’t the
end of the road but rather the beginning of another path are likely to be more
confident and successful throughout their lives. The following tips can help
Mediators improve their own self-confidence to ensure that they’re promoting this
trait in their kids as well:
•

Writing down one strength and how it helped in overcoming a specific
challenge. (“My eloquent speaking helped me to nail my most recent job
interview.”)

•

Thinking of something that causes fear or hesitation regularly – possibly a fear
of failure or criticism – and writing down three things to do to overcome this
fear, such as taking a class on speaking skills to overcome a fear of public
speaking.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

169

Parenthood

•

Working toward becoming an expert in a specific skill, like mastering the guitar
or becoming fluent in a second language – something that really promotes a
sense of competence.

•

Making a commitment to practice positive self-talk, as nothing brings down
confidence as quickly as the negative thoughts people have about themselves.
Meeting Them Where They Are

Attentive and compassionate, Mediators really do excel at supporting their kids and
providing them with copious amounts of affection. When they become too caught up
in the big picture, however, these parents may find themselves ignoring the details
of their children’s experiences. Kids at this stage want to be heard and understood,
and have their experiences validated. These types are more than capable of
providing the unconditional love and acceptance their sons and daughters need, and
can use these skills to hone in on what their children truly crave to feel understood.
Mediators who are prone to fixating on the big picture can benefit from focusing on
what their children are dealing with in the moment. Some ideas for engaging with
their kids in the “here and now” can include:
•

Starting a gratitude practice at bedtime (or whenever works) where both
parents and children state three things they’re grateful for that day, and one
thing that’s bothering them.

•

Having a parent/child date once every week or two, with the intention of
spending time listening to each other and not merely entertaining them.

•

Listening, making eye contact, and expressing interest whenever children are
speaking, and making sure parents aren’t daydreaming or staring at a screen.

•

Always acknowledging their frustrations, fears, or disappointments by using

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

phrasing such as, “I really see how frustrated you get when…” or, “I understand
your fear of…”

Find Thyself (From Approximately 12 to 18 Years)
Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood where kids focus on
developing their own distinct sense of identity. This transitional period centers
around the individual’s sense of what their roles are in their relationships with
themselves, others, and society in general. To determine their roles, adolescents in
this stage begin the all-important process of identifying their personal values and
beliefs. Educational and future career goals are made, and relationships are
developed based on how they align with these values and beliefs, making this a
pivotal, foundational stage for the rest of their lives.

Balanced Adolescent Relationships
Promote Positive Values
During this stage of identity development, adolescents need the support and
understanding of their parents more than ever. Mediator parents encourage their
adolescent children’s growth by promoting positive values, such as responsibility,
compassion, and honesty, while providing them with freedom to explore these
values in their own ways. As difficult as it can be, parents who have been through this
process themselves understand the importance of assisting their children in their
personal development, and do so to the best of their ability.
Regardless of the struggles that everyone may face during this tumultuous time,
Mediator parents can remain steadfast in their devotion to their children. Their
dedication to the promotion of their positive values, as well as their compassion
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

171

Parenthood

toward their children, provide a solid foundation which allows identity-seeking teens
to venture further into self-discovery while still feeling a sense of support and love.
Authentic and Committed
Adolescence is a tumultuous stage for most teenagers as they attempt to determine
who they are and who they want to be. These discoveries are often made through
trial and error, meaning many mistakes can be made. As one of the most authentic
personality

types,

Mediators’

honesty

and

unwavering

commitment

are

indispensable during this stage. Honesty is necessary to help teens learn from their
mistakes – adolescents who skip class need to know the potential consequences of
this behavior before it’s too late. Their parents’ steadfast commitment can provide
adolescents with the confidence to communicate with them, even when topics are
uncomfortable.
If Mediator parents can maintain their kind understanding, minimal judgment, and
authentic communication when their adolescents come to them with something truly
serious – getting pregnant, getting suspended or expelled, or milder stuff like a rough
breakup – they can establish themselves as a true source of stability and wisdom for
life when their kids need it most. As overwhelming and terrifying as some of these
situations may seem, Mediators who can tap into their confidence and empathy can
confront these situations from a place of wisdom rather than one of panic. They can
treat their teens with respect, but they’re still the wise, understanding adults in the
room.

Unbalanced Adolescent Relationships
Failing to Establish and Enforce Boundaries
The process of personal discovery is a favorite topic for many Mediators who gladly
pass their passion for growth and development on to their adolescent children. This
is all fine and good, until these parents prioritize the process of self-discovery over
establishing or enforcing healthy boundaries for their sons and daughters. Allowing
inappropriate behavior for the sake of “finding oneself” isn’t only unwise, it’s
downright dangerous.
Despite the gains that they’ve made in both intelligence and communication skills,
their adolescent brains aren’t fully developed. The prefrontal cortex – the area of the
brain responsible for complex planning, decision making, and regulating social
behaviors – isn’t fully operational until individuals reach their mid-twenties. Children
at this stage are literally incapable of fully understanding all the potential
consequences of their behavior and, as a bonus, suffer from poor social and
emotional regulation. Mediator parents who avoid setting and enforcing boundaries
because they’re afraid of infringing on their children’s autonomy can set them up for
failure.
Forgoing a curfew for teenagers out of respect for their independence can come with
serious risks, as teens without supervision are more likely to engage in dangerous
and illegal activities. Underage drinking, illegal drug use, vandalism, and unsafe sex
can seem even more exciting. Even the most mature adolescents can make poor
choices when tempting situations combine with poor boundaries and no supervision.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

173

Parenthood

Difficulty Detaching
The adolescent stage requires that children become more independent, making
critical life choices on their own and relying less on their parents for basic support.
Mediator parents can struggle with feelings of rejection if they believe their children
no longer need them or desire their affection. They may also find themselves
mourning the end of their childhood, remembering those sweet kindergarten
children they walked into class on the first day of school. If they become too absorbed
by a sense of loss at this stage, these types can slip into an existential crisis of sorts,
pining for days gone by rather than looking forward to the opportunities that lie
ahead for both them and their kids.
Additionally, for some Mediators, parenthood is their “purpose” and the most
important part of their identity. If they fail to maintain or nurture other parts of their
identity throughout their children’s younger years, these parents may fervently hold
on to their role as primary caregivers. If parenting has prevented them from
maintaining friendships, pursuing meaningful hobbies, or engaging in enjoyable
work, they may feel lost and lonely as their children inevitably begin to spend more
time away from home. They may begin to experience bitterness, a deep sense of loss,
and even a sense of panic about the uncertainty of their own future with this defining
role no longer at the center of their lives.

Rebalancing Adolescent Relationships
Creating Responsible Boundaries
Boundaries are necessary for children of all ages to gain skills and confidence in a
safe, understanding environment. Mediator parents aren’t doing their adolescents
any favors by sending them into the world without guidelines or discipline. The

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

174

Parenthood

dangers of this permissive approach are much more prominent than any potential
benefits. While enforcing rules and restricting behaviors goes against Mediators’ liveand-let-live nature, it’s important that they learn to appreciate and value these skills
for the safety and security that they provide.
Adolescents often believe themselves to be indestructible and are unable to full
realize the potential consequences of their actions. Mediator parents are responsible
for creating boundaries for their teens, from curfews to consequences for
inappropriate behaviors. Kids who are failing one of their classes may need to be
restricted from social activities or screen time until their grades improve. Likewise,
adolescents who have been spending time with a troublesome peer may need a
strictly enforced curfew. Mediators may chafe at these types of restrictions, but
they’re ultimately providing structure and security that their adolescent children are
unable to provide for themselves. The following tips can help Mediator parents have
a productive conversation about boundaries with their children:
•

Making sure these conversations take place when everyone involved is
amenable. Shouting about boundaries and expectations when individuals are
angry is unproductive and often prevents buy-in.

•

Using humor when possible.

•

Using age-appropriate language to explain how certain boundaries can benefit
adolescents both in the present and future.
Promoting Responsible Independence

The adolescent stage requires that kids become increasingly independent from their
parents by building their own sense of identity and personal values. This can be
especially difficult for Mediators who thrive on being their children’s caretakers or

Parenthood

identify primarily as parents. Rather than viewing their children’s increasing
independence as the death knell to their parental role, however, they can focus on
viewing this new stage in their kids’ lives as both a beautiful and necessary part of
their personal evolution.
Parenthood doesn’t end – ever. From birth until death, parents retain bonds with
their sons and daughters that are unparalleled in both influence and meaning. Each
stage represents a new level of this bond, and an opportunity to pass on hard-earned
wisdom. Mediators who are struggling to let go of the current manifestation of their
role as parents can benefit from pursuing their own personal growth. The following
tips can help Mediators step back and focus on finding themselves while also
remaining a source of advice and inspiration to their children:
•

Embracing a spiritual or meditative practice.

•

Taking up (or rediscovering) an artistic hobby such as writing, painting,
photography, or sewing – practicing a skill and enjoy the benefits of some
creative healing and inspiration.

•

Taking this opportunity to engage in some self-reflection through
journaling or even guided counseling, to better understand who they are
and who they would like to become.

Conclusion
Parenting is one of the most challenging experiences that anyone can face,
regardless of their personality type. Mediators have their own unique strengths and
weaknesses they need to leverage to build positive, proactive relationships with their
children. There’s tremendous potential for personal development that takes place

when becoming a parent, and Mediators can gain a much deeper understanding of
themselves and others if they use this opportunity to do so.
The advice provided above is based on general growth stages for children and basic
strengths and weaknesses that many Mediators share. Every child is different, and
parents are the best judge of what their children need. The advice above should be
used in a way that works best for each family without adding additional stress,
frustration, or burden. For special situations, such as behavioral or medical issues,
it’s best to consult with a professional pediatrician or pediatric psychologist to come
up with a plan that works best for everyone involved.

As a rare personality type that’s not always well understood, Mediators often find the
psychological impact of school is especially relevant. These types stand out as
unusual when compared to their fellow students, and the obligatory and objective
nature of the classroom can exacerbate their naturally sensitive disposition. As such,
their learning style presents distinct challenges, both for themselves and their
teachers, yet Mediators who embrace their unique style while working within a
structured educational program can find tremendous success. By learning more
about this personality type’s inherent learning style and habits, educators too can
enrich the lives of their Mediator students – and their own lives in the process.
Intuitive Learners
Mediators often don’t know why they know things. Ideas and vague notions of how
to navigate themselves academically seem to appear out of thin air for these types –
like knowing how to write a well-planned essay without any outline whatsoever. They
just know, without putting much thought into the how or why. What seems like

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

178

Academic Path

random bursts of knowledge, however, is really that their subconscious absorbs
information and connects nearly imperceptible patterns.
Known as intuitive learning, this ability to channel coherent streams-ofconsciousness into their work from these oh-so-subtle patterns makes them
students who can grasp abstract concepts quickly, understand the meaning of the
theoretical without being told, and easily and enthusiastically learn things outside
the classroom.
However, as magnificent as the gift of intuitive learning is, it actively works against
these types in conventional educational systems, as students who give concrete
evidence that they’re learning are those who reap the rewards. It’s easy to see where
the issue lies for Mediators whose thought processes are hidden – even from
themselves.
Humanistic Relevancy
Mediators have a natural grip on topics that deal with people and interpersonal
relationships. This isn’t surprising, considering how attuned these types are with their
own emotions. They use their feelings as a filter to view the world through. That’s
why courses that deal with the humanities – philosophy, literature, religion, art,
music, history, and language – frequently lure Mediators into lengthy study, but they
find frequently themselves infatuated with fascinating academic topics.
These types require a strong personal connection to a topic in order feel fully
invested, and they may wonder how important it is to learn material they have no
personal interest in. Consequently, these types usually take issue with standardized
benchmarks: They find strictly structured mandatory tests take away the
spontaneous joy of learning. Their aversion to the mundane can lead Mediators to

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

179

Academic Path

completely avoid, and perhaps discount, things outside their immediate realm of
interest.

How Mediators Learn
Mediators are capable of being amazing students who mix Intuition with inherent
precociousness, but these abilities can lead them away from well-rounded academic
paths they’re given too much leeway. These types often find their greatest success
by blending their academic resources with their own intuitions.

Balanced Learning Habits
Deconstructing the Intuitive
Mediators base their learning style in creativity, humanistic relevancy, and
spontaneity. These types rarely need to dig deeply into individual details of a subject
to start making deep connections. Typical learning structures measure success based
on assessments over details, so Mediators can feel overwhelmed and out of place in
a traditional education system. However, there’s no rewiring their brain to perform
otherwise – and nor should there be an attempt. A balanced approach to academics
for Mediators requires a merging of existing structure with their unorthodox learning
style.
The thought processes of Mediators provide them with answers first, from which
they work backwards, deconstructing the larger subject into details, facts, and
fundamentals. For example, these types may write an essay with little to no planning
involved, and then deconstruct the final draft at length. These types are apt to note
the anatomy of their essay in detail, taking stock of the outline, techniques, errors,
and revisions. Through this consideration of their spontaneous answers, Mediators
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

180

Academic Path

clarify their own learning process and improve knowledge retention, which provides
them invaluable information for learning more efficiently and thoroughly in the
future.
Mixing in Practicality
Mediators, like all Diplomats, find that subjects that focus on some sort of human
factor resonate more with them than subjects that don’t – they would rather write a
supporting essay about how myths and fairy tales reflect modern day society than
solve for “x.” However, some also understand that there’s a need for learning
“mundane” skills, like taking the time to develop long-term study habits for classes
they don’t enjoy. These Mediators develop this balanced approach because they
understand that these skills, though not dreamy and inspiring, are necessary for
everyday life.
Rather than shrugging off things they aren’t inherently interested in, these types dig
in their heels and attempt to master the material in front of them. They’re propelled
forward by the sense that the drudgery of mundane subjects is only temporary, and
that the skills they’re learning can support work they consider meaningful.

Unbalanced Learning Habits
Skipping the Fundamentals
While pondering interesting ideas, Mediators’ thinking may be too abstract to
connect to the concrete learning going on in some classrooms. While the instructor
is leading a very linear lesson where variable “A” interacts with “B” resulting in “C,”
Mediators may be massaging concepts only vaguely related to these lettered facts.
For these types, “A,” “B,” and “C” work as a springboard for their thinking, and their

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

181

Academic Path

ideas aren’t dependent on any one of them. This doesn’t mean they aren’t learning:
They might even draw their own meaningful conclusions independently. Problems
arise for these types, however, when they’re unwilling to retrace their steps to
understand how they arrived at their conclusions.
Mediators may not feel confident reciting facts, and may find it hard to concentrate
on details they’re expected to mirror on assessments like quizzes or exams. Although
in their own way, it may prove difficult for these types to repeat back what’s expected.
Many people complain that they feel competent as learners, but they “don’t test well”
– Mediators can be especially prone to this. A Mediator taking an unbalanced
approach to learning may completely discount grades and exams. This comes at their
peril: These systems of evaluation act as communication between students,
instructors, and schools. Forgoing these measures also forfeits the benefits that
come from such understandings, whether within institutions or among trusted
friends, and ultimately creates isolation and frustration with little good to show for
it.
Narrow Interests
In many ways, Mediators are generalists. Their Prospecting trait keeps them jumping
from interest to interest, giving them a wide array of things on which to focus. Still,
they may quickly shut out anything that lacks direct appeal to their inspirational bent.
Having narrow interests is one thing, but discounting topics outside that scope is
something else. When Mediators dismiss what’s outside their immediate interest,
they run the risk of being unprepared to take their true interest to the next level, as
advanced understanding of one thing may require a small understanding of all
things. Without such context, they limit their ability to advance, narrowing their
perspective – a travesty for those who value universal understanding.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

182

Academic Path

Most students love some courses and dislike others. Mediators may take this to the
next level, feeling no connection whatsoever to subjects like algebra. They may bide
their time and do the best they can to please teachers and parents while waiting to
get to philosophy or history class. This superficial approach may get the job done –
and by many measures it will be a job well done – but the value of the whole
experience as an academic learning opportunity is thrown into question.

Rebalancing Learning Habits
Solidifying the Abstract
Communication is an important part of Meditators’ learning style, and they solidify
their abstract notions when verbalizing their thoughts or writing them out. While not
necessarily shy, these Introverts may not be forthcoming with what they’re thinking,
as it’s often unconventional or even fantastical. To avoid criticism, they may learn not
to share their ideas. Nonetheless, the act of talking or writing about their thoughts –
turning abstractions into words – can be helpful.
Mediators may feel reluctant to take on the task because it may first appear as a large
mass of indecipherable information. It’s like describing the shape of smoke. Before
they can measure the ideas in their head, they must first contain them. This may
seem difficult at first, but here are some things they can do to ease the process:
•

Read over some previously written work, or write down new thoughts, for
about 30 minutes.

•

After reading or writing, go over the work again and pick out the most
prevalent/interesting/recurring patterns.

•

Write down this observation in a plain-form sentence. Describe the pattern.
Why does this pattern come up? Why did it stand out?

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

183

Academic Path

•

Apply this observation to the assignment at hand – as an outline, for example
– as proof of work.
Facts Thrive with Context

When faced with a topic that doesn’t lie within their immediate realm of interest,
Mediators can reframe it into a more interesting context. One way is using mnemonic
devices to deal with facts, especially if they’re contained within a story or put in
meaningful, and perhaps even human, context. This works for all ages, but is
particularly useful for younger Mediators.
There are a lot of ways to couch unrelated facts in things of interest. Where others
may see memorization as an education goal, this task is more ancillary to the
Mediator learning process. These types aren’t “anti-facts” as much as they don’t focus
on them in favor of bigger ideas. Creative mnemonics may be the spoon of sugar
that helps the medicine of cold facts go down for them.
The ways to attract Mediators to fact-based learning are almost endless, but some
creativity may be necessary when it comes to engaging them in some subjects.
Consider this mnemonic device that combines the planets in the solar system with
stories from mythology:
•

Swift-footed Mercury is closest to the Sun and so, like the god, runs fastest
around our star.

•

Next is Venus, named after the goddess of love and beauty as it’s also the most
stunning thing in sky.

•

War-like Mars glares red and angry at its nearest neighbor, Earth, who holds a
coveted place closer to his lover, Venus.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

184

Academic Path

This blends literature and culture with cold facts about the planets and their
locations. (When it comes to Mediators, adding a poetic feel doesn’t hurt, either.)
Such a combination makes learning a list of planets more palatable to these creative
types.

Mediators in High School
Mediators are perfectionistic in their ideals – and, in high school, they begin to look
at the world as a place that holds meaning and takes dreams seriously. This adds
enough gravitas to the high school experience that these insightful individuals do
well overall. In their striving to maintain harmony, these types work hard to get
grades that please parents and teachers. Although their burgeoning presence in the
world propels them to excellence even in challenging subjects, Mediators often must
pay special attention to whether a course is too mundane or detail-oriented for them.

Balanced High School Learning
Curious and Idealistic
The childlike wonder and curiosity of Mediators is a strength that lets them joyfully
hop from topic to topic, making instant connections along with their inclination to
easily communicate abstract concepts. In environments where structure and
standardization are preferred, Mediators can find approaches to guide their curiosity
in more practical ways rather than quashing it all together.
By creating a high school schedule that works with their interests, they can develop
points to look forward to during a long day of subjects they may not exactly be
interested in. An art class, for example, where they can freely pursue their painting

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

185

Academic Path

passion, can serve as encouragement for them to pay attention to required courses
as they pursue their own passions as well.
Making the Mundane Interesting
The courses that speak to Mediators most are the humanities and social sciences.
Literature, language, history, political science, psychology, philosophy, and similar
subjects resonate best with these students, who are riveted to any course that
includes overcoming human dilemmas. Commiserating with character from wellwritten stories appeals to both their imaginations and their emotions, and studying
an individual or culture from history feels like home for these learners.
Much of the zeal Mediators show for a social studies course disappears if a teacher
assigns lists of dates to memorize – any learning-by-rote class will lose their attention.
These types prefer a class that’s lighter on the hard facts, and they connect far more
with Hamlet’s existential crisis than the physical properties of uranium. A proper
synthesis of the two might grab these types, however: Pair that same uranium
discussion with an account of Marie Curie’s trailblazing accomplishments as a
scientist, and the subject becomes more meaningful and interesting for Mediators.

Unbalanced High School Learning
Uneven Attention to Subjects
When a subject comes easily to them, Mediators may not apply themselves to
learning. They may take it for granted that they’ll do well and not put as much effort
into tests and papers, especially if the subject doesn’t excite them personally.
Mediators aren’t typically bound by conventional rules and structure in their inner
lives. They wouldn’t necessarily perceive neglecting a subject that comes easily as

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

186

Academic Path

laziness on their part: The bigger picture always takes priority for these types, and
putting a lot of labor into seemingly mundane or unimportant work may seem
senseless. Mediators won’t lose sleep at night over their own lackadaisical attitude:
They’ll probably do just as well anyway, regardless of whether they invest time and
attention.
However, this easy success isn’t always wise. Even the smallest details have value:
Learning discipline independent of how it feels is a valuable life lesson. In fact, the
more these students step out of their comfort zone, the broader their influence on
the world around them, and the more likely they are to experience personal growth.
This doesn’t mean these types should giving up their inherent Mediator strengths –
simply that expanding their repertoire of behavior beyond what they’re used to and
prefer can be the best way to address their priorities.
Relying on Intuition
It’s at this stage in life that Mediators begin to realize that natural precociousness
may not be enough. This is a personality type who, at an early age, may have moved
from regular classrooms into more advanced classes. During that period, they may
have learned their inherent talent was enough and that studying wasn’t necessary.
This fixed mindset begins to fail them in high school, as things like structure and
studying become more important to academic success than what their Intuition can
readily provide.
Instead of recognizing that their habits are keeping them from well-rounded
knowledge, they may blame themselves for not being smart enough or working hard
enough. They can fall into the trap of believing that there’s no room for growth, and
that their natural talents fall short of what’s needed to succeed.

Academic Path

Rebalancing High School Learning
Creating a Personal Path
The main issue within Mediators’ academic careers is that their learning style doesn’t
quite fit the mold. In high school, learning how to create efficient ways to utilize their
creativity can benefit them most throughout life. While covering the required
benchmarks, these students can work at home in customized, independent ways that
allow them to learn in their own style.
Mediators can motivate themselves to deal with courses that feel mundane and
narrow by reminding themselves that discipline can work in all parts of their life.
These types might not show much enthusiasm for algebra, but learning the material
despite a lukewarm attitude can be a great exercise in self-growth. Like all Diplomats,
the idea of becoming someone better is always lingering in the background for
Mediators. If they reframe any subject as an exercise in personal development,
rather than an exercise in math, (or science, or geography), they may find the energy
needed to engage more fully in the subject. Of course, this may be asking a lot of
most adolescents. However, if nothing else, it answers the question, “How will I ever
use [subject] in my life?” Answer: You can use it to learn to become more disciplined.
Here’s how Mediators can create personal paths fit to their academic needs:
•

Consider a required subject that they’re not particularly interested in.

•

Research a prominent figure in the subject – consider Katherine Goble for
mathematics, for example.

•

Find out why this person was a revolutionary in their time.

Developing a Growth Mindset
Carol Dweck, a renowned professor of psychology, has developed a working theory
called “Growth Mindset” that focuses on motivation, learning, and the problem with
the idea of a “fixed mindset” – the idea that individuals are unable to learn anything
beyond what they’re naturally good at. Mediators can easily fall into this “fixed
mindset,” as they’re told from a young age that they’re gifted and talented, and often
resent themselves for not remaining so as they grow older. To fix this, they must first
reframe “can’t” into “not yet.”
The consequence of this “fixed mindset” is an aversion to risking failure or success,
as either could “disprove” the innate qualities Mediators see within themselves. By
embracing failure, or even success, these students can grow exponentially within
their academic careers.
Steps on how Mediator students can embrace failure:
•

Consider one failure: This could be a single assignment, a course, or an entire
subject of study.
o What about this experience makes it a failure? Take notes

•

Revise this failure into an opportunity.
o Then, write about that source of failure as an opportunity for growth: a
failed exam shows the material that could be better understood; a failed
course shows an instructor or set of ideas that never quite clicked; a
failed subject shows an area of expertise that is something to work for

•

Gather information about how this could improve.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

189

Academic Path

o Speak with the instructor who taught during this moment of failure
about improvement. Did they notice any specific or persistent
problems?
o Look up educational resources: test-taking strategies, study help for the
subject, flash cards…
•

Ask for help setting expectations. Sometimes failure is a difference in how
people define success, and by following other standards it’s easier to recognize
where those differences lie.

•

Consciously accept lessons that occur from the experiment.

Work or College?
The question of whether college is the right option is important. For some, it’s a
natural move that requires little forethought. Others may ask if college is something
they want to pursue, or when they want to pursue it. So-called “gap years” are
becoming a more popular option, as busy students seek to catch their breath before
taking their seats at their chosen universities. Older adults are more regularly
pursuing degrees later in life. Some individuals who see the success of college
dropouts like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs wonder if getting a degree is worth it at all.
While all students need to examine their motives for going to college, Mediators need
to more than others. They’re almost compelled to find meaning and authenticity in
all that they do. Participating in anything that doesn’t fit their exacting standards
leaves them experiencing regret and dissatisfaction.

Academic Path

Balanced Decision-Making
Taking the Steps Needed
Mediators may see college as a step to a career. However, they’re unlikely to see a
career as the be-all and end-all reason for making their choice. It can lead to a career,
they may think, but can the experience enhance their lives as well? Can college help
them grow? Or can they learn more from going straight into the working world? While
their sometimes-dreamy approach to life may indicate otherwise, those who take a
balanced approach to choosing college or work take practicality into consideration.
Dreams, after all, won’t pay the bills.
It’s also not far-fetched to say that, with their unconventional thinking, some
Mediators may choose alternative lifestyles off the conventional economic grid. This
might mean choosing a “grow your own” style of self-reliance over joining the
traditional workforce. These types understand their responsibilities enough to
actively participate in keeping themselves alive and thriving – they may take off-thebeaten paths like exploring the world for a year, or becoming sustainable farmers in
far-off countries.
Understanding Their Reasons
These students know that only they can make the decision to go to college. Pressure
from family or other people in their lives can lead to disaster – Mediators must see
higher education as aligned with their unique values to invest themselves fully. Other
types may be okay going to college just because others expect it of them; Mediators
find such expectations problematic.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

191

Academic Path

Jobs right out of high school also need a sense of purpose for Mediators. Choosing
employment simply to mark time and make a few dollars won’t work for them any
better than going to college without a good reason. However, “good reasons”
sometimes come in interesting forms. Higher education often serves as a stopgap
for young adults until they figure out what they want to do with their lives. Young
Mediators may want to explore this option if their search for a meaningful type of
work comes up empty. College can be a chance to explore ideas and discover new
vistas while hunting for a job title that truly fits.

Unbalanced Decision-Making
Appealing Only to Instinct
Mediators’ Prospecting trait may push them toward too many diverse interests. Their
Intuition sees a big world, and their Prospecting trait wants to reach out and embrace
it all. It can be difficult for some to choose a path. It may be easier for them to
acquiesce to the wishes of others if their own desires are too overwhelmingly
complex.
This is a personality type that doesn’t always make strong cases based on objective
facts. There are times when going on instincts works well. However, there are others
when adhering to facts is essential. Mediators might rely too heavily on an almost
spiritual direction in deference to their Intuitive and Feeling approaches to life. While
powerful intuition is a gift, when used in an off-balanced way, it can counter
reasonable arguments and lead to poor decisions.
Mediators need one foot on solid ground and the other in the heavens,
metaphorically speaking. Deciding something as important as whether to attend
college or not may be one of these occasions. Since going to college is such a

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

192

Academic Path

significant investment of time and money, deciding whether to or not needs to
combine both rationality and instinct.
Selecting for Others
The opinions of parents or other admired mentors are important to many people,
and to Mediators especially. Family may come first for these types, and they make
sure to include their loved ones in most aspects of their lives – past, present, and
future. Always conscientious of societal expectations, they may pick routes that are
deemed “proper” or “acceptable” by authority figures in their lives.
It’s at this point these students can begin down a path of passive living – letting
powerful loved ones have the majority say of the choices in their lives – even if they’re
choices that Mediators don’t particularly like.

Rebalancing Decision-Making
Choosing Their Own Path
In many areas of life, these types may need to spend time deciding what they want
and separating it from what others want. If people-pleasing is part of their college
decision, they can rebalance this by pushing themselves to discover their true
preference in reasonable yet assertive ways. However, Mediators who are standing
their ground need to understand they can’t be responsible for the reactions of
others. The college decision is one that affects their lives. Making the decision that
suits them best is the highest form of authenticity in this matter. That alone may help
motivate them to make their own choices.
Once they explore the hard facts, they can then start asking, “What is it that I want?”
“What would give my life the most meaning now?” “Am I doing this to make someone

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

193

Academic Path

else happy, or is it the right thing for me?” Some of the answers may be complex and
take some time and thought. However, the objective is to avoid doing something
simply as an act of pleasing others. While this doesn’t mean that others can’t be
pleased, Mediators need to be faithful to their values and aspirations. Without them,
they’re not likely to benefit from involvement in college – or anything else, for that
matter. Here’s a small exercise that can help:
Mediators can answer the following questions with one- to two-sentence responses,
trying to remain as clear and concise as possible.
•

When do they feel engaged and enthusiastic, work- or academic-wise?

•

When have they overcome a difficult challenge successfully?

•

When have they achieved peak performance?
o What were they doing at the time?
o What were the principles they followed?
o What did they reach that goal?
o Did they feel personally satisfied with that accomplishment?

•

Bearing in mind the challenges they face now (and possibly in the future), how
can they build on what they know works?

When these types become aware of what works for them, it makes the decision of
choosing work or college somewhat easier. And the information gathered through
this assessment applies throughout the lives of Mediators, if they’re creative in how
they apply it.

Mediators in College
After their more limited high school experiences, Mediators may find they’re finally
home when they enter the hallowed halls of higher education. College can certainly
cater to their artistic tendencies. There may be more opportunities to exercise their
powerful imaginations, and to approach some topics from the “What if?” perspective
that all Diplomats cherish. The shift from high school to college ratchets up
Mediators’ excitement for learning.
In the college setting, where they’ll likely find approval for their intellectual curiosity,
these types can spread their Intuitive wings. Mediators are allowed, perhaps even
encouraged, to explore the ideas that the high school curricula couldn’t
accommodate. Communication often becomes central to what these students do in
college. They often write impassioned pieces about subjects they feel are important,
in the process learning the value of critical thinking and purposeful writing. These
types can grow into impressive writers or even orators, often with a poetic flair.

Balanced Approach to College
Selecting the Right Courses
Mediators tend to discover that most college courses are pleasantly challenging.
These types have the passion to do well in any niche they choose, though they’re
likely to engage more in courses with a humanistic bent, which allows them to feel
genuinely connected to the subject they’re learning. Mediators need to know that
their work speaks, either to them or for them; anything less leaves them unsatisfied.
Since there’s much more latitude in college, students can more readily select courses
that speak to them. As in high school, those that fit this bill are likely to be courses

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

195

Academic Path

they can connect with personally, rather than those simply needed for future
financial success.
When a human element is involved, it changes everything about a course. Medicine
can draw Mediators if they possess a vision of the subject that exceeds labs and
medical codes. These types might well anticipate a practice with a holistic approach
that includes spiritual and cultural considerations, and that’s enough to help them
trudge through the weeds of science to prepare for a psychiatric or clinical practice.
When the reasons why are compelling enough, Mediators may tolerate any number
of specific hows or whats presented in the classroom, even against their typical
inclinations.
The Right Motivation
Those who take a balanced approach find subjects that resonate within themselves
and then find a way to make that passion a reality, whatever challenges may be
present. They search through several fields, learning from each until they’ve settled
on one that feels right.
Mediators go to college to explore ways to gain more insight and help others become
better people in a holistic sense. Of course, these types understand they must make
a living to survive. In consideration of their financial needs, they may try to find ways
to combine making a living with that which benefits society. However, the allure of
courses that foster their growth in some other way than just as a commodity or a cog
in the economic machine is always there.

Unbalanced Approach to College
No Room for Imagination
In every college career, there are unappealing but necessary courses, often under
the larger umbrella of obligation that is “prerequisite courses.” Statistics courses may
not appeal to Mediators interested in psychology, for example, yet they’re a required
and necessary tool in the discipline. As it was in high school, Mediators may respond
in such courses by exerting minimal effort. This is never a comfortable way for these
types to operate: They may complete the courses, even successfully, but with the
recognition they’ve just gone through the motions. This can feel like a waste of their
time, and even a bit phony.
It’s also conceivable that Mediators inspired by the new-found freedom of higher
academia may not bother to put in minimal effort in courses that don’t fulfill their
expectations. They may instead pursue things that resonate more fully with them
and simply neglect the rest. They may feel they’re being authentic – and their GPA
may authentically drop to match.
By disregarding the fundamentals, these types undermine their foundation. In our
example, statistics is a requirement for psychology majors because statistical literacy
is essential for applying that psychology effectively. A half-hearted effort limits
Mediators’ ability to pursue their interests meaningfully, leading to dissatisfaction
that can extend far beyond the college years.
Missing the Flow
Along the same lines, there may be times when Mediators’ Intuition cobbles together
ideas that aren’t easy to explain and aren’t constructed in a simple linear fashion.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Academic Path

While other students are walking through the steps to a conclusion, these types may
find it annoying to wait for an answer by adhering to a more organized, critical
process. They may think they’ve connected the dots, not realizing how many dots
they’ve missed. This rush to provide answers can hold Mediators back when
processes become complex enough that instinct alone isn’t enough. This can to
frustration and perhaps withdrawal from the system – and a consequent
abandonment of achievement in this aspect of their lives, further leading to that everpresent potential of an unfulfilling life.
Beyond that, there’s a certain tyranny in needing the last word, even in an individual’s
own mind. Mediators are open-minded. However, once they’ve decided something
is true, when something falls outside the realm of this truth they can become
stubborn. It’s not that they’re “hard-headed” as much as they believe they’re honoring
the truth: They’re likely to simply let alternative facts wash over them without
consideration at all, their Intuitive trait rejecting a reality check.
Not all professors are open to students questioning their material. Also, fellow
students may say things that sound too conventional to Mediators. These types
understand that their unique perspective can have them needlessly challenging
standard academic material. However, when it comes to the truth as they see it,
those who take an unbalanced approach may feel they need to push forward and
stand their ground – oddly, by withdrawing from the situation, especially mentally
and emotionally, into their own safe world.
Conflicts arise when Mediators see a need to both create harmony and to maintain
their sense of authenticity. Suppose they’re asked to write an exam essay reflecting
the thoughts of a professor with whom they don’t agree. What happens when their
professors or classmates insist they accept or write something they don’t believe is

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

198

Academic Path

true? The decision to stand their ground for the “truth” or simply play along can cause
lots of anxiety within these students. It can feel like a no-win scenario.

Rebalancing Their Approach to College
Prerequisites as Self-Help
As in high school, Mediators may need to approach duller courses as workouts in
self-discipline. Reframing these courses from meaningless inconveniences into a
training regime may help students find value in them. Life imposes necessary but
boring things on everyone. Detail and memorization that a more strictly defined
course requires, with the right attitude, can help them become better at tolerating
and dealing with the mundane.
Many worthwhile things may happen if Mediators adjust their attitude. Firstly, they
may gain discipline that provides much-needed balance to their more free-form way
of thinking. They may learn the value of being stricter with themselves when it comes
to life’s more insistent details. Secondly, they can view the time spent in such classes
as valuable, rather than a useless and artificial waste of time.
To change their perception of unappealing classes, Mediators can try these tips:
•

Review the syllabus carefully to get a clear feel of the course. Sometimes
refreshing expectations puts Mediators back on the same page as others.

•

Alongside the main course objectives and deadlines, Mediators can create
small, fun tasks for themselves that align with the course: Studying European
History? Read a Wikipedia article or two (our suggestion? Start with Boudica,
the Celtic warrior queen) and follow links wherever the interest leads.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

199

Academic Path

•

Divide large projects and assigned readings out to manage an undesirable
workload. Knowing the assigned readings, and reading, say, five difficult pages
a night over three weeks, instead of 100 difficult pages over a three-day slog,
can make something tedious into something halfway enjoyable.

•

Allow time to explore the course in whichever way is preferred. Some units
and lessons don’t appeal in any way, while others captivate – this is natural.
Mediators need to follow their interests, and can do so here.

By following these tips, Mediators can find that learning is a joyful and authentic
experience that allows their natural curiosity to run free while also completing all
course requirements.
Humbly Genuine
When these types need to reproduce ideas they don’t agree with in papers and on
exams, it can be trying for them. Mediators can become stuck in their need to be true
to themselves, which might prove impractical, as they are after all college students
learning the truths of the world around them.
A possible solution is to consider the rules of improvisation. Those comedians and
actors who practice improv are trained to say, “Yes, and…” to everything. They accept
a premise and find a creative way to add to it, even if the premise they’re accepting
is ridiculous. To avoid conflicts while maintaining integrity, Mediators may want to
start thinking of the classroom as an improv club, and every moment they’re called
on to speak as a chance to explore a new possibility.
By practicing this, these students can decide ahead of time to accept the standard
thesis of a lecture as the recognized premise for the class. They can accept that an
instructor who has dedicated considerable time and effort to their subject is now

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

200

Academic Path

trying to impart new knowledge to them, an act that’s inherently commendable.
Mediators now accepting the standard can add any of their flourishes whenever
opportunities arise.
They can apply this concept with the following steps:
•

Consider a subject that doesn’t perfectly align with accepted beliefs.

•

Consider the subject as it is to find inspiration in it.
o Subject: Trigonometry
▪

What has mathematics meant for humanity?

▪

It leads to medicine and the creation of enough food. It was
integral to the Enlightenment era’s unprecedented growth of
human potential and well-being from illiteracy and starvation.

▪

Math is a metaphor for this human growth.

Using this approach, Mediators can both enjoy the idea that they’re being true to
their understanding of something while maintaining harmony with others.

Lifelong Learning
Lifelong learning goes beyond the rigors of school, though a return to academia is
certainly an option. Older Mediators who have embraced themselves fully are better
able to give the benefit of the doubt to areas of study or schools of thought that
might have struck them as irrelevant – or worse – in their younger years.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

201

Academic Path

Balanced Lifelong Learning
Tempered Idealism
If personality types had superlatives, then Mediators would be awarded “Most
Idealistic.” Their idealism persists throughout their entire academic career and colors
what they want to learn, how they learn it, and how long it takes them to master the
subjects that interest them. They’re easily excited by the prospect of learning
something new, but when they discover how much time and effort is required once
they’re further along in the process, they’ll often feel disappointed. Mediators with a
more balanced approach reign in their idealism every so often, and learn to ruminate
less and implement more.
Consider learning Japanese, for example. It may begin with an interest in a cultural
aspect of the people who speak that language – having an online friend from a Japan,
for instance – which then inspires them to take that next step. The balanced
approach is see the language-learning process as personally meaningful, and
therefore worthy of practicing more and more, perhaps with a goal of one day visiting
Japan. Mediators draw on so many facets of an experience for lifelong learning – their
sense of adventure, their inspirations, their culture, their drive for growth, and their
curiosity – all while staying true to their own strengths.
Work and Play
Mediators have difficulty enjoying learning when the subject at hand is, as they see
it, boring. And “boring” by their standards usually means “highly technical,” and
otherwise lacking their favored humanistic traits. While they may feel inclined to
completely abandon these subjects, most Mediators ought to consider their value,
and how learning about them can enrich their lives in the long run.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

202

Academic Path

One of these values, for example, can be developing focus for work. It seems easy
enough for most people, but Mediators typically have a particularly rough time
concentrating on things that aren’t personal priorities. They can learn to focus with
time and effort, and then they’ll find that homing in on even undesirable tasks is easy
– the trick is getting there in the first place.

Unbalanced Lifelong Learning
Only Idealism
The world constantly enamors these softhearted spirits – sun filtering through the
trees, a lazy bumblebee crossing their path, snow falling around them – and this
enthusiasm translates to their learning as well. The innumerable possibilities swirling
in their heads makes them excited to learn about anything and everything. However,
while idealism is perhaps their best trait, it can also, ironically, limit them the most.
One can look to Mediators’ initial excitement over learning a new subject. They feel
the inspiration, then overthink it and talk themselves out of it before they even try.
Barriers to concrete action affect these types disproportionately.
This is more about the sheer scale of any given interest making it so that they have
no starting point. Mediators are masters of correlation – they see that everything fits
together – but are terrible at causation – understanding where things start and end.
Taking such a clear starting action is uncharacteristic, even if the lack of followthrough is.
Indulgent Learning
Learning is something that’s innately valuable and should feel joyous. Mediators
should indulge in learning what brings them joy, and recognize that learning itself is

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

203

Academic Path

an expression of joy. However, just as the saying goes, there can be “too much of a
good thing.”
When interest in a subject is absent, Mediators may feel incapable of sitting through
it. They might justify not taking the time to learn, and instead focus only on the topics
that interest them. This complete investment in interests, especially if they don’t
coincide with skills necessary for life, can be detrimental.
Focusing only on what they want, rather than what they need, can lead to huge
knowledge deficits that later reveal themselves in their professional development: If
they never learn the technical basics of writing, for instance, they’ll struggle in their
writing careers despite their inherent talent.

Rebalancing Lifelong Learning
Research and Idealism
While research isn’t Mediators’ forte, it’s sure to save them a lot of grief (and money)
in the long run. These types, though Introverted, can also be more impulsive and
indulgent with their learning, and prefer ideation over implementation. Being aware
of this trait, students with a balanced approach to learning temper their idealism with
research to preserve their most precious resource – time.
They can use their Prospecting trait to lead them to topics they find engaging and
interesting, but before they invest themselves wholeheartedly into these subjects,
they can first do in-depth research to unmake their bad habit of readily committing
with little context.
Here’s an exercise that mixes their research and idealism, and can give them a
realistic peek at adding a potential new course to their schedule:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

204

Academic Path

•

Consider the options:
o Location and time of the course: Can they make it on time? Do they face
any conflicts significant scheduling conflicts?
o Instructor: Are they well-regarded? Strict, lax? Look up online ratings,
and ask peers.
o Price: Can they afford the extra cost? Are there community-driven
alternatives to community college or university courses?
o Make sure it fits the schedule. Ask, “Am I overcommitting myself by
adding this to my daily schedule? Do I have enough time and resources
to wholeheartedly engage in the course?”

•

Look for outside opinions:
o Look up course and instructor reviews on the Internet.
o Ask friends if they’ve studied the same subject, and how it suited them.
o Contact the instructor of the course. Many instructors hold open office
hours, and a conversation can reveal whether the course is a good fit.

The information gathered can help Mediators decide whether the new course fits
into their schedule. Exhaustive consideration prevents these types from committing
long-term to an incompatible interest.
A Creative Plan
Sitting down and analyzing the basics can be difficult for all Intuitive types, but even
more so for Mediators, who are notorious daydreamers. Their wonderful minds
conjure up grand stories, but once their dreams are over, they may be left with a
huge gap between where they are and what they imagined. They may begin with Step
“A,” and their Intuitive minds skip over “B,” “C,” “D,” and all the way to “Z” – at which
point they may have no idea where to start. But some students have learned to erase

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

205

Academic Path

this confusion by going back and building a well-researched timeline that begins with
learning the fundamentals of the subject they want to pursue.
Planning can add some structure to Mediators’ often vague, lifelong goals. By
developing a loose plan that incorporates their values and desires, they can saunter
forward with confidence rather than confusion. The following exercise can help
clarify things:
•

Take the time to visualize what brings happiness – not what society says brings
happiness, but what your own experience tells you.

•

What is a goal that can be achieved a week from now?
o Remember to start small – when planning for the future, even tiny
changes can add up to big commitments.

•

What are the benefits of achieving this goal?

•

List out ten steps to take to achieve this goal.

Mediators should take their time to write out their ideal vision statement, and tailor
it their lifelong learning desires. It’s easy to begin! Start the exercise in the morning,
and look at the results at the end of the day. This is an easy exercise to repeat, and
growing Mediators often find themselves surprised at the changes they see from day
to day.

Conclusion
Life is Learning
For Mediators, education is a way to move closer to the world and people around
them. But it can be so much more for those willing to take a chance. The challenge
for these types isn’t so much in the hard work of learning – the challenge is managing
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

206

Academic Path

their imaginations and finding a reasonable footing so that education is rewarding
experience. For Mediators, balancing their passion and soft hearts with practical and
realistic expectations is quite achievable, and even more satisfying.
They can achieve this balance by taking time for setting plausible expectations for
themselves, taking time to find meaning and merit in the mundane, understanding
that an A+ doesn’t equate to self-worth, and allowing themselves room to be wrong,
as well as celebrating their accomplishments and failures in equal turn.
In the end, it’s important to note that balance and imbalance are states, and neither
state lasts forever. All of us, as a collective, go back and forth. Like the seasons,
balance comes and goes. The trees grow taller and stronger, and people grow
smarter and wiser, all of us advancing in our way. As we make progress, we come to
knowing those seasons.

Career and Professional Development

Career and Professional Development

Rare, complex, and enigmatic, Mediators seek careers that are more than just jobs.
Whatever their profession, they need a role than enables them to support worthy
causes and exercise creative freedom. This combination motivates them to make
great contributions and do their best work.
Throughout this section, we’ll discuss how Mediators can maintain balance, excel in
their professional development, identify the factors that may frustrate that
development, and learn how they can utilize their strengths to regain their balance
and thrive in their careers. Ultimately, we hope this guide offers the understanding
and tools to help Mediators find professional fulfillment.
Putting Idealism to Work
Some people strive for materialistic or egoistic goals – a salary, title, number of
subordinates, or impressive degree. Mediators, however, want to do something
meaningful and help others. To put this idealism to work, they must find roles that
suit them.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

208

Career and Professional Development

Mediators often find the greatest happiness when they dare to explore their interests
rather than settle for a typical path. Although doing so may require trial and error –
and, at times, great effort – the journey is certainly worthwhile. Following their
instincts while still challenging themselves to do their best work can help Mediators
grow both professionally and personally.
Restless Hearts
Mediators like to feel that their actions have purpose, and they aim to foster
harmony, understanding, and connection. Unfortunately, those qualities aren’t often
the currency of the world of business. Common career paths may not fulfill
Mediators, leaving them feeling isolated, restless, or unsatisfied.
Although they’re capable of great dedication when inspired, Mediators usually dislike
routine tasks, strictly impersonal work, and analysis of minor details, so they may not
thrive in careers that focus on data rather than people. To be happy, people with this
personality type usually need creative roles. But, with inspiration, even the most
data-driven or technical field can be pursued as an art, whether coding a video game
or riveting an airplane.
Despite their longing for human connection, their Introversion means that they can
be exhausted by prolonged contact with others. People with this personality type
need to be on their own occasionally; if that doesn’t happen at work, stress can build.
Some jobs, such as most sales and customer service positions, require that
employees be “on” throughout their shifts. These jobs can be exhausting – though
potentially still fulfilling – for Mediators.

Career and Professional Development

Suitable Careers for Mediators

Professional development takes place across all stages of life, from early education
through retirement, and it’s interwoven with personal development as well. Gaining
increased self-understanding – by determining values, goals, strengths, and
weaknesses – is essential. In this section we’ll help Mediators gain a deeper
understanding of the role personality type plays in choosing a suitable career.
What follows isn’t a firm prescription as to what Mediators must do to be successful
or happy. Rather, we hope it provides some decision-making insight. Perhaps the
most important question for Mediators to ask when searching for a career isn’t,
“What do I want to be?” but, rather, “Who do I want to be?”
Creative Arts
It can be difficult to turn artistic talent into a paycheck. Fortunately, Mediators who
pursue creative careers needn’t be starving artists. As freelancers or employees
within a larger corporate structure, such as a staff writer at a magazine or a
commercial artist at a brand-strategy firm, they can earn a solid and sustainable

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Career and Professional Development

living. Almost any subject imaginable has an accompanying publication, and a
knowledgeable Mediator might be the best candidate for their creative direction.
The world isn’t always as non-hierarchical as Mediators would like, and they may find
that specific training or education facilitates their entry into artistic fields. For careers
such as architecture, the right credentials and degrees can open doors, allowing
Mediators to conceive and execute truly grand, creative masterpieces. Similarly,
formal training in programming may help Mediators find work in web design, video
game design, or even certain types of multimedia production.
If Mediators struggle to balance financial demands with their creative impulses, they
have the option of pursuing their passions as side projects. Thanks to technology,
reaching a wider audience no longer requires a full-time career in the arts: In their
free time, Mediators can experiment with self-publishing their fiction, sharing their
films on streaming video services, selling crafts through social media markets…the
possibilities grow with each passing year.
Of course, in-person connections also help. To maintain their motivation, Mediators
may benefit from connecting with other artists in their communities, sharing time
and inspiration with them. Taking classes is a great way to find other people who
care about making art.
Here are a few careers particularly well-suited to the Mediator personality type:
•

Artist: fine arts, commercial art, graphic design, photography, illustration,
sculpture

•

Musician: songwriter, composer, producer, performer

•

Crafts: fiber arts, pattern designer, woodworking

•

Architect

Writer: novelist, editor, essayist, copywriter
Health Care

Positions in health and wellness leverage Mediators’ empathy, giving them a sense
of purpose and enabling them to make a difference. Whether they specialize in
mental or physical health, Mediators can help others gain insight into their behaviors,
achieve self-discovery, and improve their well-being. An ideal position also allows
Mediators to exercise their creativity to help their clients feel better. Certain
healthcare jobs also suit Mediators’ Introverted natures, such as those that allow
them to serve patients individually, with time between clients to reflect on the
experience.
Healthcare positions that may suit Mediators include:
•

Medicine: physician, nurse or nurse practitioner, school nurse, physician’s
assistant, midwife or doula, physical therapist, dentist or dental assistant,
optometrist,

paramedic,

dietician,

health

coach,

Ayurveda, sound healing, Reiki, the Alexander Technique, the Feldenkrais
Method, Emotional Freedom Technique, etc.; herbalist; yoga or meditation
teacher; breath-work teacher

Career and Professional Development

Education
Mediators are well suited to teaching and working with students. They connect with
younger students through imagination, intuition, and empathy. With older students,
they present topics with passion and creativity, especially when teaching the
humanities.
Regardless of whom they teach, Mediators treat their students as individuals with
specific traits and needs. They look beyond test scores and conventional metrics of
success, glimpsing the unique potential of each student. Although Mediators may
find constant contact with students and colleagues throughout the day taxing, they
nevertheless enjoy the sense that they’re changing lives for the better.
In addition to roles as teachers or professors, Mediators might consider other
education-related careers such as guidance counselor, school nurse, school
psychologist, or even sports coach. Depending on their personal religious beliefs,
Mediators also make excellent religious instructors and leaders, sharing their
compassion and love for humanity within their belief system.
Some educational roles that may fit Mediators’ skills and preferences:
•

Preschool, elementary, or high school teacher

•

College lecturer (especially in religion, philosophy, or literature)

•

Adult-education teacher

•

Guidance counselor

•

Sports coach

•

Religious educator

Career and Professional Development

Public Service and Social Work
Thanks to their ethical standards and caring natures, many Mediators are drawn to
public service and social work. Despite their acute sensitivity, their desire to serve
others gives them the strength to face tragic and painful situations. They can support,
comfort, and advocate for those in need through a variety of roles. Any
administrative tedium can be balanced by Mediators’ love of directly talking to,
comforting, and helping people in need.
Of course, public service isn’t limited to office jobs. Some Mediators feel called to do
environmental work, such as nature conservation and restoration, or positions
within the public, state, or federal parks system. Such roles offer opportunities for
outdoor solitude as well as personal contribution – a combination that appeals to
many Mediators.
Specific public service jobs Mediators might enjoy include:
•

Social worker: specializations include community, health care, family, or
military

•

Non-profit employee or director

•

Librarian

•

Community organizer

•

Outdoors: conservationist, park ranger, environmental researcher, landscape
architect, forester, wildlife researcher, marine biologist, geoscientist,
oceanographer

Career and Professional Development

Service Industry
For Mediators, making a difference in someone’s life – or even just their day – is
deeply gratifying. Provided they find environments that allow meaningful
interactions with customers, Mediators can thrive in retail or service businesses. By
offering personalized recommendations and truly listening to customers, people
with this personality type can cultivate a loyal, appreciative clientele.
Beyond the constant opportunities to help people, lower-pressure service jobs can
offer the flexibility to continue their education or pursue personal goals in their free
time. Such roles can even prepare entrepreneurial Mediators to open their own
independent businesses. For those who enjoy it, the service industry can be a longterm career fit. From luxury hotels to fine restaurants, some high-end businesses
offer surprisingly generous compensation to experienced employees, particularly in
cities and travel hubs.
That said, it’s important for Mediators to find employers whose missions and cultures
resonate with them. People with this personality type require jobs that align with
their values and allow them to be their authentic selves.
Some positions in the service industry that may be a good fit:
•

Food service: restaurant host, server, or manager; barista; bartender;
sommelier

•

Hospitality: hotel employee or manager, bed-and-breakfast owner, vacation
rental host

•

Retail store associate or manager

Career Alternatives
We live in an age of possibilities, and selling one’s time to a corporation isn’t the only
way to earn money. Mediators are imaginative individuals, and their ability to make
connections between seemingly unrelated things and ideas can be very valuable
beyond the realm of conventional employment.
Self-Employment
Many people find the notion of self-employment quite scary, but the working world
has changed radically, and job security is less of a guarantee, even with stable, large
employers. On the plus side, self-employment comes with a range of benefits, such
as the ability to plan one’s time, direct oneself, and see the tangible results of work
done. Mediators enjoy independence and creative latitude, and being self-employed
provides both – whether as freelance writers, graphic designers, tutors, coaches,
consultants, or something else entirely.
Unfortunately, starting a business without a solid plan can lead to frustration,
heartache, and an empty wallet. Mediators have a strong aversion to the pressures
of salesmanship, but finding a worthwhile cause and turning it into an ethical
business idea can be incredibly rewarding, both financially and morally – enough to
justify a little risk and stress. The keys to success include good ideas that speak to
others and strong relationships with vendors and clients. Mediators’ human insight
and vibrant imaginations serve them well in these areas.
If considering the path of self-employment, Mediators must be willing to experiment,
work hard, and fail along the way. Success is far from guaranteed, and at times the
demands of going solo may stretch them beyond their comfort zones. Fortunately,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

216

Career and Professional Development

self-employment grants Mediators the independence to follow their passions, and
their natural charisma reflects well on whatever service or product they offer.
Professional Volunteerism
Those who devote themselves entirely to pursuing matters of conscience and
progress can move mountains. Although unlikely to lead to financial prosperity, the
path of volunteerism can offer unparalleled personal satisfaction and growth. Early
on, such efforts may have to be supported by minor income from other endeavors,
but Mediators may also transition into volunteerism later in life, offering wisdom and
vigor as well as skill sets from previous occupations.
Regardless of their background, experienced and educated Mediators can find ways
to apply their abilities and knowledge to worthy causes, especially if they’re willing to
travel. From welders and carpenters to teachers and doctors, any skill set can be
useful in the right environment. Mediators can establish small volunteer groups or
even act individually. For example, almost anyone with warmth, patience, and a high
school education can contribute by tutoring children in reading and math, and doing
so can make an incredible difference in the youngsters’ futures.
By following the path of volunteerism, Mediators can satisfy their desire to create
harmony and healing in the world. They can dip their toe in while keeping a day job,
or plunge into the deep end and devote their time entirely to helping others.

Workplace Roles
Many Mediators enjoy working without any sort of hierarchy or leadership structure,
at a level neither above nor below anyone else. Directly interacting with the people
and ideas that are relevant to what they’re trying to accomplish is the dream for these
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

217

Career and Professional Development

types. That said, Mediators do sometimes need to step into leadership roles or
positions of authority to transform their visions into reality – and for these types, that
transition to leadership can represent a monumental challenge. Fortunately,
Mediators are creative and inspired people: Under the right conditions, most any
position can work.

Mediators as Subordinates
Balanced Subordinate Behavior
Infectious Positivity
Managers who recognize excellence and correct errors gently can expect strong
commitment and cheerfulness from Mediator employees. If Mediators believe in
their work, they throw their hearts into it. Praise from managers and coworkers
reinforces their enthusiasm and delight, cementing their natural positivity into
lasting loyalty.
When they feel appreciated, Mediators find additional ways to be helpful around the
workplace, whether by chipping in on an additional project or by developing a plan
to tackle a longstanding problem. In validating environments, they’re more likely to
speak up in group settings and offer their insights. Even better, their positive energy
is infectious, brightening the workday for their peers – and often their managers as
well.
Helpful Accountability
Mediators can most easily leverage their strengths when given sufficient time and
space. They don’t like time crunches or tight deadlines, preferring instead to consider

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

218

Career and Professional Development

and review their work. Many Mediators have a perfectionist streak; given the
opportunity, they take as much time as possible to assess and revise their ideas and
efforts before inviting outside scrutiny – a trait that garners them a reputation for
being insightful and reflective.
However, some jobs – particularly subordinate roles – don’t offer this latitude, which
means that self-aware Mediators must find strategies to work efficiently. Although it
goes against their independent natures, they may need outside support to avoid
procrastination and stick to deadlines. They might create accountability by asking a
manager or a colleague for regular check-ins, allowing them to track their progress –
or lack thereof – rather than ignore it. Counter to their own intuitions, Mediators
often find that strict deadlines help them by forcing them to break their habit of
passive idealism and perfectionism. Over time, people with this personality type can
ease into doing work that’s “good enough,” rather than holding out for perfection.

Unbalanced Subordinate Behavior
Hypersensitive to Criticism
Although they want to grow, Mediators are highly sensitive to conflict and criticism.
Often suffering from fragile confidence, they’re vulnerable to becoming hurt and
confused when people disagree with them, dislike them, or are unkind. In the
workplace, even minor corrections or negative feedback – from coworkers, clients,
and especially managers – can take the wind right out of their sails.
When conflict or criticism is aimed at them personally, they lose their objective
negotiating skills. They’re at risk for becoming social loners if they don’t find kindred
spirits, or at least respectful peers, in the workplace. Emotionally marginalized

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

219

Career and Professional Development

Mediators may withdraw like hermits, viewing the outside world and other people
with anything ranging from wavering wistfulness to reserved resentment.
To cope with workplace critics, these types may find themselves acting in a host of
unproductive ways. They might amplify the self-critical voice in their heads, aiming
to anticipate every possible rebuke that might be launched their way – a surefire
recipe for perfectionism, procrastination, burnout, or worse. Or they might shut
down, shying away from new challenges and avoiding people who’ve criticized them
in the past. Unfortunately, such reactions prevent Mediators from distinguishing
between helpful and unhelpful feedback, adjusting their course accordingly, and
making their full impact in the world.
Disillusionment
Principled and idealistic, Mediators need to feel good about the culture of their work
environment. To them, the moral and emotional foundation of any pursuit matters
more than quantitative returns. When managers prioritize profits and pecking orders
while disregarding morale and fairness, then Mediators can turn from whistling
workers into disgruntled detractors.
Ideally, they can transform this disillusionment into positive action, either by
advocating for reform or by seeking a better work environment, but if they allow
themselves to feel helpless, their disappointment with management simply saps
their motivation. Mediators can numb out by dragging their heels on tasks,
withdrawing from people or projects they disagree with, or wasting precious energy
bemoaning the situation rather than working to change it. This dynamic is doubly
destructive, as it not only prevents Mediators from doing their best work, but also
damages their sense of personal integrity.

Rebalancing Subordinate Behavior
Reassessing Praise and Criticism
Many Mediators are tempted to avoid criticism and pursue praise. This can lead to
imbalances in their skill sets, robbing them of opportunities to bolster their
weaknesses, benefit from constructive feedback, and understand their true goals for
their work, independent of other people’s opinions. All too often, this approach
prevents them from tackling the grand challenges that result in lasting change.
To escape this trap, Mediators must learn to balance their inner wisdom with
feedback from managers, colleagues, and clients. They can do this by reminding
themselves that other people’s opinions provide valuable information – about the
opinion-giver, not only the person being judged. If a manager criticizes them for
writing long emails, that may simply mean that the manager prefers concise
communications. A different manager might appreciate the thought and nuance that
go into longer messages.
On the flipside, if they’re praised for making a big sale, that doesn’t necessarily mean
they should work as a salesperson. The key is for Mediators to respond rather than
react to feedback, by reflecting on its motivation, value, and potential helpfulness
before absorbing or deflecting it.
Here are some ways Mediator can adjust their reception to feedback:
•

Rather than accepting managers’ opinions as fact (or dismissing them out of
hand), insert them into the following formula: “My managers believe [insert
opinion]. This teaches me that they would prefer [insert corollary preference].”

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

221

Career and Professional Development

o Example: My managers believe that decisions should be made based on
statistics rather than emotions. This teaches me that they would prefer
that I ground my suggestions in data.
•

Decide whether to honor the corollary preference: in the example above, this
can be done by bolstering all suggestions with data going forward.

•

If the managers’ preferences or opinions seem out of line, approach the
situation as if a miscommunication has occurred. Broach the matter directly
with managers. It may not be easy, but an honest discussion clears the air and
eliminate any false assumptions. (Mediators’ diplomatic skills serve them well
in such sensitive conversations.)

•

When faced with constructive feedback, look for ways to grow – and develop
a plan to pursue them.

By steering themselves away from assumptions and remember not to take criticism
as a personal attack, Mediators can choose how to respond to feedback, rather than
reacting on instinct. Integrating helpful critiques and leaving the rest behind equips
these types to steer by their internal compass.
Quashing Helplessness
When managers violate their principles, Mediators lose motivation. They might
isolate themselves from colleagues or perform their tasks halfheartedly, no longer
bringing their typical creativity and optimism to their work. Over time, this can lead
to underperformance, which is likely to erode Mediators’ self-esteem and sense of
purpose.
The culprit in this situation is helplessness – an emotion that clashes with Mediators’
hopeful, idealistic spirit. To cope, they can brainstorm concrete ways to improve their

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

222

Career and Professional Development

work environment, and then follow through with action. Steps can be large or small,
from bringing in baked goods or leaving nice hand soap in the bathroom to chatting
with coworkers who are struggling.
Mediator subordinates can also stand up for their principles in ways that are
available to them. The following ideas can empower Mediators to do this:
•

Before suggesting changes, consider what changes are desired and why. When
presenting any change in policy or idea for improvement, take stock of existing
resources. Knowing what policies already exist can further emphasize the
benefit of new ideas.

•

Note the reasoning, including the pros and, when they’re obvious, cons of the
plan. Even a plan with drawbacks yield overall improvement – and sometimes
more feedback can eliminate or minimize flaws.

•

Approach a respected colleague for feedback. A second perspective can spot
hidden flaws in the plan, as well as opportunities.

•

Practice presenting the ideas before meeting with a manager. Schedule
enough time to ensure the entire idea can be presented, as well as any
questions answered.

•

Offer to take responsibility for implementing the idea. Trust the vision enough
to make it a reality.

Even without managerial authority, Mediators can be beacons in their workplaces,
ushering positive change and brightening their own experiences as well as those of
their colleagues.

Mediators as Colleagues
Balanced Colleague Behavior
Goodwill and Empathy
Mediators’ empathy and sensitivity can be a balm to coworkers. Always offering
gentle support, friendship, and a helpful attitude, they add warmth and human
understanding to nearly every aspect of their workday, setting up themselves and
everyone around them for success. Regardless of where they fall on the career
ladder, they model kindness and consideration, inspiring others with their sincere
efforts.
Their goodwill is more than a morale booster – it can increase productivity. Although
they do well independently, Mediators are wonderful team players, thinking less
about their own acclaim than about how they can elevate and energize the team.
When they allow themselves to fully develop this quality, they can increase a team’s
productivity by encouraging harmonious cooperation, staving off conflict, and
fostering true team spirit.

Unbalanced Colleague Behavior
Naïveté
Mediators’ positivity charms many people, breathing fresh life into stale workplaces.
That said, this trait may cause blunt or cynical coworkers to judge them as naïve.
Hard-edged colleagues often roll their eyes at Mediators’ tendency to assume that
every problem is solvable and that everyone is well intentioned.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

224

Career and Professional Development

When faced with workplace conflict, Mediators may put their trademark positivity
into overdrive, refusing to take sides or even acknowledge tension. Such situations
make people with this personality type deeply uncomfortable, and their desire to
remain friendly with everyone may alienate them from frank, strait-shooting
colleagues. As a result, Mediators may end up accidentally at odds with people they
haven’t wronged, simply by refusing to speak up about a situation.
No Solitary Time
Despite their need for solitary time, people with this personality type may struggle to
withdraw to be on their own. This phenomenon becomes particularly pronounced if
coworkers or clients keep requesting their help, which is common because many
Mediators struggle to establish boundaries around their time and space when they
feel people need them. This consideration for others may seem beneficial, but in the
long run, it sticks Mediators in “survival mode.”
Solitude is essential for these types to refill the fonts of energy and empathy that fuel
them to be such powerful agents of positive change. When they force themselves to
be in constant contact with others, Mediators’ morale suffers, leading them to exhibit
uncharacteristic negativity, which can dampen their colleagues’ spirits as well. Unless
they manage to carve out pockets of alone time, Mediators won’t do their best work.
Quiet reflection typically enables them to generate their best ideas; without it, they
can feel uninspired, unmotivated, or simply down.

Rebalancing Colleague Behavior
Facing Conflict
Although Mediators might wish for drama-free lives, the reality is that all workplaces
break into conflict occasionally. When this happens, they may struggle to identify the
source of the tension, leading them to “take everyone’s side.” However, in some
situations, they must face conflicts head on and take sides.
When faced with workplace drama, the first question Mediators must ask themselves
is: “Is this any of my business?” If the situation involves one of their own projects, a
close colleague, or a clear ethical infraction, then they probably need to get involved
– whether by helping to remedy the situation or by weighing in with their professional
opinions.
If the situation doesn’t involve their work or their close colleagues, Mediators may do
well to curtail their instinct to help – otherwise, they may be viewed as meddling,
particularly if they don’t have the authority to put their natural diplomacy and people
skills to full use. Here are some ways Mediators can refrain from involving
themselves unnecessarily:
•

When workplace conflict arises, pause to reflect: “Would the situation benefit
from my involvement?”

•

If the answer is yes, consider your response. If someone pushes for a snap
judgment in a non-emergency, then reply, “I need time to find out what’s going
on first.”

•

If the answer is no, don’t step into the conflict unless asked. However well
intended, such efforts can backfire.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

226

•

Speak to a trusted colleague and ask what’s going on, especially about the

tension.

catastrophizing among Mediators, so gaining a clear awareness of the
situation may help mitigate stress.
•

Manage your own resulting stress, if necessary: Take deep, slow breaths; listen
to a guided meditation, such as progressive muscle relaxation or yoga nidra;
or set aside some alone time.

Rather than rush to involve themselves, Mediators can evaluate conflicts and then
decide how to respond. By doing so, they maximize their chances of making a
positive impact – whether that means helping to resolve an argument or simply
keeping their heads down to focus on their own projects.
Creating Alone Time
Without pockets of alone time, Mediators tend to burn out. As much as they might
enjoy helping and listening to others, they need to retreat from time to time to
restore their energy, inspiration, and sense of capability. Otherwise, their satisfaction
with their jobs – and themselves – gradually wanes, as does their confidence that
they can make a difference.
For the many workers who lack private offices, taking alone time poses a challenge.
Fortunately, Mediators excel at finding creative solutions. Those in sales or retail
might approach their managers with requests to take on solo tasks, step out for
solitary lunches, or start their workdays before others arrive. From time to time,
Mediators in noisy, open-plan offices can put on headphones. This not only tunes out
other people’s conversations, but also broadcasts that they’re trying to focus,
minimizing the likelihood of social distractions.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

227

Career and Professional Development

To gracefully withdraw from unmanageable workplace environs, Mediators can
employ any of the following:
•

Pay attention to your personal tolerance level for sustained social interaction.
Some people go for hours without becoming depleted, whereas others can
manage less, and certain activities, such as group meetings or watercooler
chat, drain more. By knowing how you respond to such situations, you can
anticipate when you’ll need a break.

•

Devise a list of ways to take alone time at work: wearing headphones, walking
around the block, eating lunch alone, switching to a task that requires less
social interaction, retreating to a bathroom stall for a few minutes, etc.

•

Take a few deep breaths while counting down from 10, and relax into the
present moment. This can help minimize the stress response, even during
prolonged social exposure.

•

Take on more independent tasks. Brainstorm a list of tasks in advance and
approach your supervisor, and come with a willingness to negotiate so you get
what you want. Or, approach colleagues with offers to take on or trade tasks.

Many Mediators adapt creatively to social workplaces by carving out pockets of solo
time. As a result, these types can excel in a range of fields, even those that require
significant interaction with others.

Mediators as Managers
Balanced Manager Behavior
Egalitarian Leaders
Unsurprisingly, Mediators don’t impose their will on the people they manage.
Instead, their cooperative tendencies lead them to solicit the opinions of their
employees, creating an egalitarian and democratic work environment. Unlike
micromanagers, Mediators give the people who work for them plenty of space to
innovate and experiment, and they encourage creative thinking over strict adherence
to protocols and deadlines.
Because Mediator managers view their employees’ potential as more important than
their pay grades, their team members’ talents are used rather than left to languish.
This fosters a non-hierarchical workplace where even junior staff members can make
suggestions, exercise their judgment, and receive credit for their contributions. The
result is that Mediators – despite their general reluctance to exercise authority –
often bring out the best in the people they manage, encouraging them to grow and
develop both personally and professionally.
Cultivating Talent
As managers, Mediators are open-minded, respectful, and always willing to offer
support. Aiming to act as mentors rather than rule as dictators, they get to know their
employees as individuals, learning the strengths and abilities that each person brings
to the table. As a result, they excel at cultivating talent, allowing their mentees to
grow into capable allies.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

229

Career and Professional Development

Trusting the talent of their employees, Mediator managers often delegate
responsibility. They’re comfortable sharing their power and discretion with people
who have earned their respect and trust. Mediators also encourage the people they
manage to put their own spin on projects, valuing their employees’ creativity,
spontaneity, and unique perspectives above adherence to predetermined standards
or procedures.

Unbalanced Manager Behavior
Letting It Slide
Although Mediators have high expectations for themselves, they don’t always apply
the same expectations to others. People with this personality type are averse to
conflict and reluctant to criticize, and they tend to see the best in other people. If left
unchecked, these traits can lead them to overlook bad behavior in their employees,
prioritizing their relationships with team members above the success of the team.
As a result, Mediators can be too lenient, even when genuine incompetence surfaces
– a situation that ultimately damages team morale. It’s fine for them to give their
employees the benefit of the doubt, but they should try not to ignore poor
performance or bad behavior. When they don’t uphold standards, Mediators not only
diminish their teams’ chances of success, but also de-motivate the employees who
hold themselves to a higher standard.
Pressure Cooker
Mediators don’t often seek out leadership positions, in part because the burden of
managerial responsibility weighs heavily on their shoulders. Unfortunately, the
pressures of command can get to them, especially in high-profile or particularly

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

230

Career and Professional Development

visible positions. If they don’t keep their inner perfectionism in check, Mediators may
overreact to stressful situations, lose their cool in crises, or overthink every decision.
Such tendencies can affect their ability to lead. Because they so desperately want to
do things right, Mediator managers may delay important decisions, allowing
themselves to get distracted by other priorities. As a result, they may find themselves
either becoming paralyzed by indecision or making impulsive choices – neither of
which ultimately benefits their workforce.
When they or their teams don’t succeed, Mediator managers may criticize
themselves harshly, feeling they’ve letting others down. Their powerful imagination
might envision scenario after scenario of future failures, leaving them reluctant to
maintain their managerial responsibilities. In the absence of firm encouragement
and guidance from colleagues – which may be difficult to find at the managerial level
– the pitfalls of a typical workplace can leave Mediators feeling lost, stressed out, or
even depressed.

Rebalancing Manager Behavior
Establishing Expectations
Mediator managers don’t have to refashion themselves into tyrants to set
expectations for their employees. In fact, their positive natures can work in their
favor when it comes to communicating new, higher standards. Although other
personality types might use criticism to spur on employees, this strategy can be
incredibly discouraging.
The Gallup Leadership Institute has found that teams perform best when their
managers think they’re capable of great things. Mediators can leverage this

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

231

Career and Professional Development

phenomenon – known as self-fulfilling prophecy – by communicating the potential
they see in each of their employees and praising people for doing things right. They
might even encourage their teams to take on “moonshot” projects that bring them
to the edge of their abilities in pursuit of grand challenges.
That said, even smaller suggestions can lead to self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether their
aim is improved sales or better workplace conduct, Mediator managers can explain
themselves in positive terms – for example, “improved productivity” as opposed to
“reduced distractions.”
To reinforce positive self-image among their employees, they can also conclude
discussions by explaining to their subordinates that they’re fully capable of creating
change. Here are some ways they can frame feedback in productive ways:
•

Comment on team members’ strengths and talents, highlighting each person’s
capacity to grow into their potential.

•

Praise employees for their effort and their improvement.

•

Suggest “moonshot” projects that encourage employees to push in new
directions.

•

Use positive language to communicate new expectations.

•

Emphasize to employees that they can achieve what is being asked of them.

Positive reinforcement can help Mediator managers encourage their teams to
perform to higher standards – without shaming them for past failures or slipups.
Pressure Relief
When faced with crises, impossible deadlines, and past failures, Mediator managers
may feel helpless and overwhelmed. No matter how much they doubt their abilities,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

232

Career and Professional Development

they’re often more than capable of rising to such challenges. To do so, however, they
need to take off some of the pressure they place on themselves. Although they might
think their inner critics motivate them to improve themselves, Mediators are more
effective leaders and change agents when they embrace a balanced view of their
abilities.
To keep perfectionism from undermining their leadership skills, Mediators must set
realistic goals, enjoy their successes, and curb procrastination. Although they may
want to achieve great things – such as turning around a company’s culture, or
providing millions of people with access to clean water – Mediators can become
overwhelmed and distracted unless they establish smaller, shorter-term objectives.
When they or their teams do achieve their objectives, they should take a moment to
acknowledge each success, reminding themselves of their essential capability.
Mediator managers must take note when they lapse into procrastination – whether
putting off tasks or postponing decisions. They can enlist a more decisive or proactive
colleague to help them move forward rather than stall out. As this tendency to delay
action can escalate quickly, consider these tactics:
•

Within the scope of larger visions, establish achievable, shorter-term
objectives. If you normally think in years, consider goals for the next day or the
next week.

•

Celebrate progress, no matter how incremental. Whether with a team dinner,
an office announcement, a calendar entry, or even a private journal entry, it’s
important to counterbalance memories of past failures – which tend to
dominate our minds, thanks to a phenomenon known as negativity bias – with
awareness of successes and accomplishments.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

233

Career and Professional Development

•

Recognize procrastination when it arises. For many Mediators, a dead
giveaway is physical uneasiness or a sense of being scattered or dissatisfied.
Enlist support, ideally from an action-oriented colleague, to maintain progress.

These actions create a cycle of progress, affirmation, and momentum. Even better: If
they mitigate their stress levels by setting realistic goals and enjoying their successes,
Mediators can feel less inclined to procrastinate in the first place.

Workplace Cooperation Between Types
Even when they don’t share similar backgrounds or experiences, Mediators and
coworkers can forge a healthy and productive workplace relationship. The following
section explains how Mediators can use their strengths and counterbalance common
sources of conflict to build meaningful work relationships with various personality
types. As these types well know, conversations that include mutual understanding
tend to be much more productive than those that proceed with assumptions or
stubborn perspectives.

Mediator–Analyst Cooperation

Balanced Mediator–Analyst Cooperation
Kindred Insights
Both Mediators and Analysts prefer to advance the “big picture” rather than fiddle
with mundane details of facilitation. Both absorb knowledge almost subconsciously
and then incorporate it into a larger constellation of meaning, often connecting
concepts in deep ways. Their similarity in style and shared love for the abstract give
Mediators and Analysts ample opportunities to imaginatively combine their talents.
In the workplace, they excel at working together to generate new ideas, identifying
areas that need improvement, and departing from the status quo. Their patternrecognition skills enable them to investigate the root causes of problems and detect
unexpected relationships. Not only would they notice their organization isn’t gaining
enough publicity, but they might also recognize the origins of the problem in the way
their organization presents itself to the outside world. Together, these two types can
steer companies in new directions, spotting avenues for growth and improvement
that others may miss.
Compatible Differences
Mediators’ values and deep empathy can provide necessary balance to Analysts’
interest in optimization – and vice versa. Mediators can add to Analysts’ perspective
by emphasizing emotional elements and offering human insight. As a result,
Mediators can infuse “soul” into any system that Analysts devise, ensuring that
objectives aren’t met at the cost of people’s well-being.
Of course, an organization that values love, peace, and harmony sometimes needs a
reality check to sustain its mission. Rational, impartial analysis – something that

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

235

Career and Professional Development

doesn’t necessarily come easily to Mediators – is often required for a project to
succeed in the long run. They can rely on Analysts to provide a critical counterpoint
to their potentially damaging optimism. If running an organization together is like
captaining a ship, then Mediators can be entrusted to conceive the journey and
Analysts can be relied upon to optimize the route.

Unbalanced Mediator–Analyst Cooperation
Hiding Hurt Feelings
To put it mildly, Analysts share their opinions freely and they are less conflict-averse
than Mediators. When Analyst colleagues disagree with them, even in minor or
constructive ways, especially sensitive Mediators may interpret the comments as
judgmental or unfair. This can hit Mediators hard, making them feel unappreciated
or unwelcome in their workplaces.
Faced with blunt commentaries from Analysts, Mediators may disengage, avoiding
their Analyst colleagues whenever possible. They may also hesitate to share their
views and opinions, shy away from challenging projects, or struggle to maintain focus
on their tasks. Because they don’t interpret disagreement as a personal affront (and
often even enjoy it), Analysts may not even realize they’re having such a strong
detrimental effect on their Mediator colleagues.
Caring or Naïve?
When Mediators and Analysts don’t respect each other’s priorities, their working
relationships can become tense and unbalanced. Mediators may become alarmed
when Analysts make decisions based purely on logic and expediency rather than

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

236

Career and Professional Development

taking relationships and people’s feelings into account. When Mediators voice their
objections, they might find themselves labeled “naïve” or “soft.”
Confident and ever rational, Analysts are likely to shoot down Mediators who
advocate for kindness over logic, accusing them of emotional decision-making (as
though it isn’t a valid perspective) or even questioning their intelligence. Mediators
may suffer such brusqueness quietly but feel deeply hurt. If they truly feel their
principles are being violated, however, they may hit an emotional breaking point,
unleashing uncharacteristic anger and frustration on their colleagues.

Rebalancing Mediator–Analyst Cooperation
Nothing Personal
As intelligent and insightful as they are, Analysts are notorious for being emotionally
chilly, often unintentionally (but not always!). In many cases, they dispense with
common cordiality in favor of efficient, to-the-point communication. It may seem to
sensitive Mediators that Analysts are intentionally unfriendly, when their intent is
efficiency.
Once Mediators realize that Analysts’ behavior rarely indicates any actual negativity,
they can lower their defenses and enjoy their relationships. Of course, “Don’t take
things personally,” is easier said than done. Here are some strategies that can be
helpful:
•

Pay attention to personal beliefs and expectations about how people “should”
act in the workplace – for example, “People should offer feedback gently and
considerately.”

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

237

Career and Professional Development

•

Notice the interpretations that underlie these expectations. Does it feel like a
personal attack if someone cuts down an idea without acknowledging its
merits? Does it feel as if they’re trying to convey personal disdain rather than
impersonal feedback?

•

Pay attention to situations that trigger your expectations. In the moment,
come up with alternative explanations, even if they seem unlikely. Could the
person just be doing things the way they think is best? Might their behavior
reflect their personality and their life experience – rather than a personal
attack?

Many Analysts don’t ascribe to common societal expectations, even those that seem
“obvious.” When Analysts seem rude, harsh, or inconsiderate, Mediators can
generate alternative explanations rather than taking the behavior personally.
Direct Communication
As much as they might want to avoid difficult conversations, the best way for
Mediators to communicate with Analysts is directly. When they feel that
communication is blocked, or a misunderstanding has occurred, they can ask
Analysts where the disconnect lies and how they might work together to prevent
similar problems in the future.
Candor is important in this case – not only because Analysts respect it, but also
because they’re less emotionally attuned than Mediators and may not be aware of
the issue in the first place. By adopting a straightforward yet sincere approach,
Mediators can gently – by Analyst standards – draw attention to any rifts and steer
the conversation toward solutions.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

238

Career and Professional Development

Mediators can also facilitate communication by asking insightful questions. Analysts
love to share their opinions, so by asking questions, Mediators can better understand
their opinions without getting sidetracked into disagreement. In fact, this type of
conversation may motivate Analysts to inquire about Mediators’ opinions.
Analysts generally respect people who ask good questions and prompt interesting
discussions, so a questions-based conversation may pique their curiosity about
Mediators’ alternative viewpoints and ideas. Here are some suggestions for
facilitating communication:
•

Cultivate genuine curiosity about the situation.

•

Communicate directly yet sincerely – for example, “What would you identify as
the best possible outcome for this project?” or “How do you think we can work
better together in the future?”

•

Ask thoughtful questions. Don’t be afraid to dig deep. Analysts love follow-up
questions that allow them to delve into the many layers of a situation.

•

If Analysts ask questions in return, be honest and straightforward. Don’t
hesitate to share opinions, but don’t be surprised if Analysts expect the
opinions to be supported by facts, data, or theories. This is simply how their
minds work.

Shying away from conflicts with Analysts is rarely productive. Although it isn’t easy
for them, Mediators can facilitate productive interactions with their Analyst
colleagues by being direct and authentic, rather than walking on eggshells or
withdrawing altogether.

Visions and Ideas
Mediators and other Diplomats have the advantage of speaking the same “language”
– they’re visionaries focused on growth, humanity, and exploring ideas. Others may
talk about the nuts and bolts of an organization, but these personality types talk to
one another about creating harmony and growth in the workplace. Although they
may appear overly idealistic to other types, they agree among themselves that
progress is always possible.
Together, Mediators and other Diplomats can breathe fresh air into any workplace.
They might brainstorm a plan to more fairly distribute time or labor, for example, or
they might launch an initiative to donate a portion of proceeds to charity. Although
they delight in the kindred spirits of their fellow Diplomats, their empathy and
openness allow them to understand the value of different perspectives.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

240

Career and Professional Development

For example, Mediators might consult a Thinking or Judging type for help with
logistics or implementation. When other types offer critical feedback, Mediators and
Diplomats know instinctively how to support each other through the process – or
support each other in their next effort, if their initial idea turns out to be truly
untenable.
Finding Purpose
For Mediators and other Diplomats, work is most exciting when its purposeful on a
deep level. These two quickly target any injustice or unfairness in a business, and
they may form strong alliances around such matters. Unwilling to sacrifice their
values to turn a profit or meet a benchmark, they agree that a cold, calculated
approach to work or business is never the right path, particularly if it’s conducted at
the expense of people’s feelings or well-being.
In balanced situations, these two augment their idealistic, principled perspectives by
collaborating with other colleagues, even those who might be more utilitarian or
analytical. Provided they remember the inherent fairness of respecting others’
opinions, Mediators and Diplomats are poised to recognize the unique strengths
their coworkers bring to the table.
By bringing together different perspectives and styles of thinking, they can allow
their purposeful ideas to reach fruition in a way that aligns with everyone’s interests
and takes advantage of everyone’s abilities. This not only gets things done – an arena
where Mediators and Diplomats may struggle on their own – but also fosters
egalitarianism and meritocracy in their workplaces.

Unbalanced Mediator–Diplomat Cooperation
Diplomat Island
Mediators and Diplomats often delight in working together, recognizing each other
as all-too-rare kindred spirits. They must take care, however, not to limit their
interaction with colleagues who think differently – even those who think
“conventionally.” Otherwise, they put themselves at risk of becoming stuck in their
own style of thinking, missing out on opportunities to challenge their opinions and
expand their worldviews.
In business and in life, it’s good to have varied personality types around to provide
balance. With their focus on ideas instead of deadlines, Mediators and Diplomats
who opt to work in a vacuum may generate grand ideas that go nowhere, or their
inherent optimism may cause them to underestimate practical challenges. Unless
they enlist – and listen to – other opinions, they may fail to effect the positive changes
that mean so much to them.
Talk, Talk, Talk
When Diplomats sequester themselves from other viewpoints, they tend to focus on
guiding principles, mission statements, and long-term visions – at the expense of
tactical plans. Inspirational discussions can be an important launching pad toward a
better future, but without a concrete how-to strategy, idealistic discussion may lead
to gridlock. Endless discussions do more harm than good, and these two types must
be particularly careful not let inertia set in when the job calls for action.
This dynamic often manifests itself when Mediators and other Diplomats face tough
decisions, such as axing failing projects or slashing budgets. These are difficult topics

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

242

Career and Professional Development

for Diplomats to analyze objectively, given their idealistic drive to search for solutions
that benefit everyone –solutions that, in some cases, simply doesn’t exist. Without
reality checks from other personality types, these two may put off necessary
decisions for too long, ultimately damaging their – and others’ – prospects of success.

Rebalancing Mediator–Diplomat Cooperation
Second Opinions
Mediators and Diplomats may enjoy each other’s company so much that they
inadvertently become cliquish, excluding colleagues who think differently. These two
types are fiercely egalitarian in principle, but at times the joy of finding a kindred
spirit can completely blind them to the ways that they wall off others. Not only does
this make their coworkers feel unwelcome or unheard, it also robs Mediators and
Diplomats of the opportunity to hear alternative perspectives. In many cases, outside
perspectives are essential for progress, as they offer an important counterbalance to
Mediators and Diplomats’ dauntless optimism and big-picture worldview.
To correct for any imbalances, Mediators and Diplomats can solicit the opinions of
other coworkers – even coworkers who might seem stodgy or pessimistic. To
broaden the conversation, they can include other coworkers in brainstorming
sessions, meetings, and even informal discussions. Mediators’ natural desire to
include and listen to others comes in handy here.
Mediators and Diplomats can also solicit others’ opinions to loosen the reins on their
self-imposed perfectionism. When they fall short or fail to deliver, these two may
languish in self-blame to the point that they cannot move forward at all. Instead, they
can use their natural empathy and compassion to support each other in
acknowledging their weaknesses and asking for help from colleagues whose

243

Career and Professional Development

strengths provide counterbalance. It’s perfectly fine to approach a colleague and say,
“I’m struggling with this project. Would you mind looking over my work for blind spots
or other issues?”
To solicit help from others, Mediators and other Diplomats can:
•

Create a list of all colleagues who might be approached for help. Briefly note
their strengths, such as troubleshooting, financial analysis, or neutral analysis
of workplace politics.

•

Approach those people one-on-one when help is needed with a specific issue.

•

Explain that you’d like an opinion on something, and ask whether they have
time to speak now or if a later time would be better. If approaching them in
person is too daunting, set up a time over email or text message.

•

Come armed with specific questions, such as, “Does this seem feasible to you?”
and “What would you recommend?”

•

Establish appropriate expectations. Make it clear that you are asking for an
opinion, not directives, and that you may proceed differently.

•

Take notes during the conversation. Afterward, look through your notes and
circle action items. Schedule a time to implement the actions or integrate them
into the current plan.

•

Afterward, thank the person for their time. Follow up to let them know how
you have implemented their advice, if appropriate.

•

Remember that, however awkward it may feel to ask for help, people are
generally flattered and intrigued when asked to give their opinions.

Everyone has something to contribute. By drawing others into the conversation,
Mediators and Diplomats leverage the full diversity of their colleagues’ strengths.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

Career and Professional Development

Slow It Down
Idealistic goals often benefit the workplace, but they must be crafted one piece at a
time with focus and care, not just hope. Mediators and Diplomats can encourage
each other to slow down just a little, even when they feel success is guaranteed.
Instead of leaping forward to an assumed outcome, they should take the time to
assess and review each stage of a potential project. This enables them to use their
imaginations to identify potential pitfalls as well as opportunities for improvement.
In meetings as well as informal discussions, Mediators and other Diplomat types can
remind each other to devise action plans to back up their big ideas. Failing that, they
can enlist other personality types who take a more hands-on approach: Sentinels and
Explorers in particular can help Diplomats identify realistic, achievable steps in
pursuit of any grand goal.
•

After identifying a promising goal or idea, take a moment to assess it. How
many people-hours would the project entail? What benchmarks would have to
be met? Who would need to contribute, and what specific tasks would they
handle? If you focused on this idea, what other projects or tasks wouldn’t get
done? Write out answers to these questions.

•

Solicit opinions and advice from people with other thinking styles.

•

Chart out each stage of the project, incorporating the insights received in the
previous step. Specifically consider any potential issues that might arise. What
adjustments can be made to preempt or address them? Do they make the idea
unfeasible?

Without sacrificing their trademark optimism, Mediators and Diplomats can support
each other to translate their big ideas into action steps and timelines. That way, they

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

245

Career and Professional Development

won’t get derailed or distracted as they tackle the wonderful projects they conceive
together.

Mediator–Sentinel Cooperation

Balanced Mediator–Sentinel Cooperation
Human Interest
Both Mediators and Sentinels see the value of human connection in the workplace,
albeit in different ways. Mediators’ interest is more intuitive and ideological, whereas
Sentinels focus on the practical groundwork necessary to forge and maintain
relationships. For example, Mediators might quickly detect the mood of a potential
client or customer. Upon hearing those insights, Sentinels can navigate the necessary
steps to bolster the underlying relationship.
As a result, Mediators and Sentinels can excel at collaborating on matters that involve
people, such as human resources, hiring, and even negotiations. With Mediators
offering a high-level view of what is right, fair, or just, Sentinels can then tackle the
on-the-ground practicalities necessary to structure benefit packages, collect

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

246

Career and Professional Development

references, or get a contract approved. When these two types communicate and
cooperate fully, their differing strengths create a human-centric synergy that
facilitates goodwill as well as progress.
Creativity Meets Diligence
Mediators and Sentinels complement each other by providing different kinds of
support for an organization. For Mediators, the larger picture and big ideas are
important. Directives that come across as strict or nitpicky may feel frustrating or
needlessly harsh to them, so they sometimes miss small but essential details.
Sentinels don’t, and their diligence and guidance can complement Mediators’
creativity to ensure that work runs smoothly, and the organization prospers.
Mediators can help Sentinels tune into the intangible side of human interaction, and
Sentinels can help Mediators stay on target when it comes to precision, productivity,
and tough but necessary decisions. Sentinels can encourage and guide Mediators
when practical focus is needed, helping them keep their feet on the ground while
striding in the right direction. In a balanced relationship, Mediators recognize that
Sentinels’ insights – however nitpicky they might initially seem – will foster
improvement and progress. As a result, Sentinels can motivate Mediators to stick
with work that seems tedious to get things done.

Unbalanced Mediator–Sentinel Cooperation
Rules vs. Flexibility
Sentinels may place procedures and professional responsibility above other people’s
feelings, which can alienate and even hurt sensitive Mediators. When Mediators are
tired, uninspired, or struggling, they consider it reasonable to take personal time and

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

247

Career and Professional Development

adjust expectations. However, Sentinels may well expect them to push through and
get the job done anyway – an expectation Mediators might take personally, especially
if they struggle with insecurity.
In such situations, Mediators might feel trapped. On one hand, they may believe that
Sentinels are being unreasonable; on the other hand, it pains them to fall short in
their colleagues’ eyes. Typical workplace issues such as tardiness, precision, policy
adherence, and follow-through can trigger this dynamic, with Sentinels insisting on
strict accountability and Mediators struggling to juggle workplace performance with
their life circumstances – an inherently stressful situation.
Good Enough?
Driven by idealism and grand visions, Mediators always strive toward improvement
and a better future. Because Sentinels generally value and adhere to proven
standards and methods, Mediators’ dreams of different realities may exasperate
them. Sentinels appreciate the status quo and are reluctant to fix things that aren’t
broken, especially when the bottom line is already adequately served.
As a result, these two may disagree about engaging new ideas, whether a new socialmedia strategy or a different way to arrange merchandise. When Sentinels disregard
Mediators’ visions for change, Mediators may interpret the feedback as a personal
attack. In turn, Mediators may find themselves accused of wasting time or “messing
with success” in their search for better ways to do things.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

248

Career and Professional Development

Rebalancing Mediator–Sentinel Cooperation
Reasons for Rules
Although practical strictures may stymie their optimism, Mediators can cultivate an
appreciation for what might seem like nitpickiness in their Sentinel colleagues. In
many cases, details matter immensely; sometimes someone must uphold rules and
keep an eye on the bottom line. Instead of resenting Sentinels for their traits,
Mediators can learn to value having help with things that aren’t necessarily their
strongest qualities.
When Mediators spot this silver lining, they should thank Sentinels for their efforts.
Although they might not ask for praise, Sentinels work incredibly hard, even in the
face of personal challenges, and they’re grateful when their dedication is
acknowledged. A simple acknowledgment and word of thanks can help them
maintain motivation or get through a difficult day.
Mediators can work most effectively with Sentinels by demonstrating – rather than
talking about – cooperation and compromise. For Sentinels, actions truly speak
louder than words. Here is a framework that can facilitate the process:
•

Fully listen to and consider Sentinels’ suggestions. Ask questions about their
rationale and the results they’d like to see.

•

Implement – or at least experiment with – one of their suggestions. Approach
the endeavor with an air of curiosity, open-mindedness, and discovery. The
experiment can take many forms, such as conducting “AB” testing (comparing
two ideas simultaneously) or piloting an idea for a specific amount of time.

•

Track the results of the experiment, noting the full range of micro and macro
benefits. Have budget cuts been avoided? Did a process go more smoothly

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

249

Career and Professional Development

than it usually does? Review your insights with colleagues – including Sentinels
– and work together to decide how future scenarios might be handled.
•

Thank Sentinels for their ideas and their contributions.

By experimenting with Sentinels’ rules and noting the benefits, Mediators may come
to recognize these colleagues as hardworking, principled allies, always willing to pitch
in and help to move things forward.
Progress and Compromise
In tense working relationships, Mediators and Sentinels lock horns over new ideas.
Because Sentinels often defend the status quo, Mediators are left to demonstrate
the merits of the alternatives they envision. However, because of their Intuitive and
Perspective traits, Mediators may have difficulty supporting their ideas with concrete,
specific evidence – the type of evidence that would sway Sentinels.
There are several potential remedies to this situation. If Mediators don’t have their
Sentinel colleagues’ trust, they may need to prove their ability to structure an
effective plan – for example, by learning project-management techniques or by
creating SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound).
The frameworks may help Sentinels feel confident that Mediators can balance their
inherent idealism with an awareness of logistics and practicalities.
Mediators can also adopt the following approach to suggest changes to Sentinels:
•

Review the current protocol thoroughly. Collect data on its performance, if
available. List benefits and weaknesses.

•

Outline the proposed alternative in concrete terms. What specific changes
need to be made? Who will do the work? How long will the project take to reach

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

250

Career and Professional Development

fruition? What are its specific advantages? For example, will it bolster customer
satisfaction or increase sales? How can its success be measured?
•

Consider potential counterarguments to the new idea. Evaluate their validity
and plan replies in advance.

•

Meet in person with the Sentinel and present the above analysis. A written
copy is helpful, as are charts (if relevant).

•

Suggest changes as evolutions of the current procedure rather than a radical
departure.

•

Solicit feedback and take notes. Integrate the feedback into a revised version
of the idea, if possible.

Mediator–Explorer Cooperation

Balanced Mediator–Explorer Cooperation
Always Improving
The common ground between Mediators and Explorers may be difficult to define,
but it certainly exists. Both enjoy moving forward in life and striving for improvement,

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

251

Career and Professional Development

although their approaches are different. Whereas Mediators often approach
challenges by considering large-scale ideas and implications, their Explorer
colleagues excel at finding practical solutions to specific problems.
When it comes to workplace issues, these two can approach any issue from different
angles to solve it complementarily. Mediators can offer creative vision, opening the
doors for change and improvement. Explorers can then tackle problems that arise,
explaining how to make things work – often in unique and exciting ways. Given their
shared respect for flexibility and experimentation, these two types are powerful allies
in pursuit of innovation.
Here and Now
When Mediators get lost in their mental chatter, they can count on Explorer
colleagues to snap them out of it. Explorers find the exciting side of things, whether
they’re learning how to use a new tool or troubleshooting on the fly. As a result,
Explorers can teach Mediators to set aside their worries – which are almost always
about the future or the past – and encourage them to fully inhabit the present
moment.
Working with Explorers offers Mediators a break from their minds and a chance to
lose themselves in the work at hand – a respite that suits their Introverted and
Intuitive natures. If they struggle with perfectionism, Mediators may frequently
second-guess themselves in the workplace – losing their nerve, leaving tasks undone,
and failing to act on their ideas. Given their delight in the here and now and their
keen eye for novelty, Explorer colleagues can be a refreshing change for otherwise
restrained Mediators. Their energy and vigor can reignite Mediators’ motivation,
helping them to follow through on their plans.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

252

Career and Professional Development

Unbalanced Mediator–Explorer Cooperation
Values vs. Utility
Although established standards don’t bind either Mediators or Explorers as tightly as
they might Sentinels, Mediators do live by a code. Their values are active forces in
their lives, as real as any actions. Explorers have values of their own, but they focus
more on utilitarian solutions than ideals, which influences the way they handle
business. For instance, Explorers might be relatively willing to fire underperforming
employees or bolster sales by taking client lists from their competitors – two
behaviors that would probably wound Mediators’ sense of principle.
In discussing workplace plans and practices, Mediators may sometimes be
concerned about Explorers’ disregard for human consequences over goal
achievement. This can build into a mutual resentment, with Mediators seeing
Explorers as disregarding ethical standards and Mediators being constant downers
who let nothing slide or who have no fun, leaving the two unable to cooperate at all.
Second-Guessing
If their worries outweigh their self-confidence, Mediators fall into the trap of overthinking everything and indulging in endless what-ifs. By contrast, Explorers like to
move quickly into action. If Mediators get in Explorers’ way, they may find themselves
labeled “wet blankets.” Although it sounds innocent enough, this criticism may be
disheartening to Mediators, who view themselves as free spirits at heart. Faced with
this type of feedback, Mediators may doubt their abilities, second-guess themselves
even more, or shut down altogether.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

253

Career and Professional Development

Of course, these aren’t ideal conditions for collaboration and cooperation. If
Mediators retreat from their Explorer colleagues to escape judgment, they
compromise the incredible potential these two must cancel out each other’s
weaknesses. In addition, Mediators may carry their hurt feelings and self-doubt to
other arenas of their lives, from their relationships to their passion projects.

Rebalancing Mediator–Explorer Cooperation
Calls to Action
Mediators may not agree with Explorers’ utilitarianism – in other words, their
prioritization of expediency and results no matter the consequences for other people
– but that doesn’t mean they can’t work together productively. In fact, open-minded
Mediators are uniquely poised to appreciate Explorers’ creativity (if it isn’t too
impulsive or outlandish). This appreciation can go a long way with Explorers, many
of whom aim to achieve mastery in their work.
So how can Mediators work with Explorers in a way that leaves both parties feeling
capable, confident, and creatively energized? First, Mediators should avoid longwinded explanations and philosophical musings – two surefire ways to lose
Explorers’ interest. However poetic or insightful, these conversations strike Explorers
as idle chitchat, and they won’t persuade them to pitch in on a human-centric project.
If they ask for assistance on a project that upholds their personal values, Mediators
may be pleasantly surprised by Explorers’ willingness to help – if Mediators frame
their requests in a way that captures Explorers’ interest, that is. Wherever they stand
on the workplace hierarchy, Explorers love fixing things; if a task interests them, they
take it on without hesitation. Here are some hints Mediators can use to approach
their Explorer colleagues:

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

254

Career and Professional Development

•

When asking for help from Explorers, specify how they can act. “Can you find
a way to improve our company’s image?” is too vague. But, “This is driving me
nuts. Can you help me find the bug on this web page?” outlines a concrete,
present-moment problem that needs solving.

•

Explain further only if asked. Lengthy explanations don’t motivate Explorers.

•

Feel free to use colloquial language, joke, and create a fun environment.

•

End the conversation on a clear call to action, which is ideal for Mediators and
Explorers. Both benefit from a sense of actionable urgency.

•

Pay attention to how Explorers proceed, most likely taking immediate action
and finding the fun or novel side of the task. Note the benefits of their
approach.

•

Thank Explorers for their help.

For Explorers, lofty philosophical discussions are less compelling than practical
benefits and a sense of discovery. By tailoring their communications accordingly,
Mediators are more likely to persuade their Explorer colleagues to collaborate on a
variety of projects, including those that are close to Mediators’ hearts.
Appreciation
Compassionate and creative, Mediators can use their interpersonal attunement to
establish common ground with Explorers. Specifically, they can strive to translate
their big ideas into the specific, tangible problems that capture Explorers’
imaginations. This may not come naturally to Mediators, but it enables them to view
their work from an entirely new – and uniquely helpful – perspective.
Over time, Mediators can use their empathy to cultivate a wholehearted appreciation
for Explorers’ perspective. Perhaps more than any other personality type, Mediators

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

255

Career and Professional Development

viscerally understand the value of diverse approaches. If everyone were alike, the
world would be a dull, barren place – and this goes for the workplace as well. With
Explorer colleagues, they can marvel at the opportunity to work with people who are
wholly different from themselves. With that perspective, Explorers’ behaviors – even
their criticisms – are worthy of curiosity, as they offer a window into a different way
of seeing the world. Here are some suggestions that can help Mediators with
embracing their perspective:
•

Approach Explorers with a sense of genuine curiosity.

•

Seek out the lessons that they can teach, including how to take quick action
and seize opportunities.

•

Take notes on how Explorer colleagues behave in urgent, high-stress
situations. How do they communicate? What do they do? Explorers’ example
can be helpful for Mediators, many of whom struggle under pressure.

•

When appropriate, experiment with replicating Explorers’ behavior; for
example, take immediate action after a meeting rather than leave it for
another day.

When communicating and cooperating fully, Explorers and Mediators cover each
other’s weaknesses and complement each other’s strengths. These two can tackle
just about anything, and their interest in progress and innovation can unite them in
unexpected yet powerful ways.

Conclusion
Mediators’ strengths – including creativity, empathy, and human insight – are
invaluable in many workplaces. To achieve job satisfaction, however, they must
harmonize their work with their personalities. This often entails unhooking from
“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

256

Career and Professional Development

praise and criticism, balancing social interaction with alone time, and relieving some
of the pressure they place on themselves.
In interacting with coworkers, Mediators must balance their sensitivity and optimism
with the necessities of facing conflict, managing criticism, and soliciting alternative
viewpoints. It isn’t easy, but it’s certainly achievable, and the resulting confidence and
equanimity will only bolster Mediators’ overall growth and development. Provided
they approach work with a mindset of service and self-efficacy, Mediators can carry
the resulting sense of meaning and purpose into every aspect of their lives.

Progress from the Heart and Mind
In all aspects of life, Mediators can use their natural qualities to wonderful potential,
advancing themselves and others through conscious change. In a world of diverse
challenges, these types can develop skills to handle whatever they may encounter
without compromising their values, allowing them to function effectively and
complete what they put their minds to. The adaptive yet focused mindset of
Mediators opens endless possibilities, whether in romance, career, or personal
expressions of creativity. Their open-mindedness can be one of their greatest virtues,
especially when combined with willful action. Mediators have the great advantages
of adaptability and imagination: if you can dream it, there’s a good chance Mediators
already have, and if it’s a passion of theirs, they may have taken the first steps to turn
dream into reality.
Their hearts are no less open, and no less a virtue for progress. Whether they’re
looking inward to discover the nooks and crannies of their own being, or forming
strong relationships with family members, coworkers, or friends, Mediators’ deep

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

258

Final Words

human understanding helps move them forward in life. Although they’re not likely to
desire positions of social leadership, these types nonetheless often naturally become
a nexus of bonding. People can’t help but be enchanted when they discover how
warm and caring these types are, as well as what they can offer. When Mediators
choose to step out of insecurity and isolation, their open hearts provide them with
endless opportunities to strengthen their lives by surrounding themselves with good
people – and to develop their own inner strength.
Adapting Natural Qualities
This openness and flexibility can become liabilities when Mediators lose sight of their
own goals and needs, whatever they may be. They know in their hearts what’s right
for them, but can get distracted by sweeping emotions, external pressure, or even
their own unending curiosity. By deciding on and committing to their own priorities,
these types can create personal growth and success in all areas of life. Whether this
means working on self-discipline in school or on the job, or standing up for their own
needs in their personal relationships, their amazing potential can be fully realized
only when they balance their receptive spontaneity with some consistent
determination.
This isn’t to say that Mediators should abandon their dreamy, contemplative,
impulsive side – it’s the wellspring of their creativity and the source of their great
potential. If anything, these types can find balance by acting on the many wonderful
ideas within them, welcoming others’ input without losing their own sense of power,
and sharing in people’s emotions without being subject to them. For Mediators,
learning how to navigate the external world while maintaining happy individuality is
a lifelong process. They may make just as many mistakes as anyone, but their
optimism gives them an advantage over many other types.

“The Mediator” (INFP, -A/-T)

259

Final Words

Even in the face of failure and heartache, Mediators bounce back. As these types
mature and grow, they learn to craft their flexibility into a structure of internal
support with just the right amount of give – their strength is supple enough to never
break. Likewise, Mediators turn their variability into an asset when they apply
focused energy, remaining highly adaptable in the pursuit of their goals and passions
without straying from them. With personal balance, practice, and a healthy dose of
self-forgiveness, there is nothing in the world that people with this sweet, sensitive
personality type cannot achieve when they step forward in life.
We’ve covered many different topics in this profile, and we hope that the chapters
have offered insight and answered questions about the Mediator personality type.
We hope that readers will now find it easier to understand other people and their
perspectives. This profile isn’t meant to be read just once. When trying to understand
another person better, or struggling to understand oneself, another read-through
can offer fresh insight.
Furthermore, spend some time on our website – for example, in our articles section,
research zone, or the Academy. There is a wealth of inspiring advice and information
on the website, and we strongly recommend that you take a look. If you have some
spare time, consider lending us a helping hand by contributing to the translation
project, taking additional surveys, or simply sending us a message and sharing your
thoughts about this profile or the website in general. We would love to hear from
you.
We wish the best of luck to all Mediators. What matters most in Mediators’ lives is
that their paths through life reflect who they are, deep within. Reflecting on values,
dreams, and ideals often reveals the right path through life by clearing out superficial
distractions. Our lives are often too full of troubles, conflicts, and worries. By working

to better understand each other, we can make our relationships, communities, and
world more aware, more genuine, and more peaceful.
