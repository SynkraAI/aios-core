                   What’s in This Profile?
This profile is designed to cover all the main aspects of the Protagonist personality

type as it affects different areas of their life, including key strengths and weaknesses,

relationships, academic path, career and professional development, as well as their

communication and friend-making styles, parenting tips and advice, and much, much

more. It combines personality type theory with practical, real-world advice from

other people who share the Protagonist personality type.


Personality types have been the topic of many discussions, some of them dating back

to ancient times. It’s wise to draw from this source of knowledge and experience,

especially when unsure of how to handle a specific situation. This kind of knowledge

offers the power to control and understand oneself. As Aristotle said millennia ago,

“The hardest victory is the victory over self.” Consider this profile a plan for success.

               The Puzzle of Personality




When they receive their personality test results on our website, most people’s first

question is, “What do these letters mean?” We are of course referring to those

mysterious acronyms – INTJ-A, for example, or ENFP-T. As you may have already

learned from the type descriptions or articles on the website, the five letters of these

acronyms each refer to a specific trait, with certain trait combinations forming

various types and type groups. But before we discuss those traits in depth, let’s

explore their historical foundations.


Since the dawn of time, humans have drawn up schematics to describe and

categorize our personalities. From the four temperaments of the ancient civilizations

to the latest advances in psychology, we have been driven to fit the variables and

complexities of human personality into well-defined models. Although we are still

some time away from being able to do that, the current models account for our most

important personality traits and can predict our behavior with a high degree of

accuracy.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           5
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


Personality is just one of many factors that guide our behavior, however. Our actions

are also influenced by our environment, our experiences, and our individual goals.

This profile describes how people belonging to a specific personality type are likely to

behave. We will outline indicators and tendencies, however, not definitive guidelines

or answers. Significant differences can exist even among people who share a

personality type. The information in this profile is meant to inspire personal growth

and an improved understanding of yourself and your relationships – not to be taken

as gospel.


Our approach has its roots in two different philosophies. One dates back to the early

20th century and was the brainchild of Carl Gustav Jung, the father of analytical

psychology. Jung’s theory of psychological types is perhaps the most influential

creation in personality typology, and it has inspired many different theories. One of

Jung’s key contributions was the development of the concept of Introversion and

Extraversion – he theorized that each of us falls into one of these two categories,

either focusing on the internal world (Introvert) or the outside world (Extravert).

Besides Introversion and Extraversion, Jung coined the concept of so-called cognitive

functions, separated into Judging or Perceiving categories. According to Jung, each

person prefers one of these cognitive functions and may most naturally rely on it in

everyday situations.


In the 1920s, Jung’s theory was noticed by Katharine Cook Briggs, who later co-

authored one of the most popular personality indicators used today, the Myers-

Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®). Briggs was a teacher with an avid interest in

personality typing, having developed her own type theory before learning of Jung’s

writings. Together with her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, they developed a




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           6
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


convenient way to describe the order of each person’s Jungian preferences – this is

how four-letter acronyms were born.


Of course, this is just a very simplified description of the Myers-Briggs theory.

Readers interested in learning more should read Gifts Differing: Understanding

Personality Type by Isabel Briggs Myers. As we define personality traits and types

differently in our model, we will not go deeper into Jungian concepts or related

theories in this profile.


Due to its simplicity and ease of use, the four-letter naming model is now shared by

a number of diverse theories and approaches, including Socionics, Keirsey

Temperament Sorter®, and Linda Berens’ Interaction Styles, among many others.

While the acronyms used by these theories may be identical or very similar, however,

their meanings do not always overlap. As a result, if you meet five people who say, “I

am an INFJ,” their understanding of what that means may vary significantly.


Regardless of its structure, any type-based theory will struggle to describe or

characterize people whose scores lie near the dividing line. A different way to look at

personalities is through the lens of a trait-based rather than a type-based model.

What do we mean by that? Instead of creating an arbitrary number of categories and

attempting to fit people within them, a trait-based model simply studies the degree

to which people exhibit certain traits.


You may have heard the term Ambivert, which is a perfect example in this case.

Ambiversion means that someone falls in the middle of the Introversion-Extraversion

scale, being neither too outgoing nor too withdrawn. Trait-based theories would

simply say that an Ambivert is moderately Extraverted or moderately Introverted and

leave it at that, without assigning a personality type.



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          7
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


A trait-based approach makes it easier to reliably measure correlations between

personality traits and other characteristics – for example, political attitudes. This is

why trait-based approaches dominate psychometric research, but that’s more or less

the only area where these approaches are dominant. Because they don’t offer types

or categorizations, trait-based theories don’t translate as well as type-based theories

into specific recommendations and takeaways. Assigned categories such as Extravert

or Introvert may be limiting, but they allow us to conceptualize human personality

and create theories about why we do what we do – something that a more

scientifically reliable but colorless statement, such as you are 37% Extraverted,

simply cannot do.


With our model, we’ve combined the best of both worlds. We use the acronym format

introduced by Myers-Briggs for its simplicity and convenience, with an extra letter to

accommodate five rather than four scales. However, unlike Myers-Briggs or other

theories based on the Jungian model, we have not incorporated Jungian concepts

such as cognitive functions, or their prioritization. Jungian concepts are very difficult

to measure and evaluate scientifically, so we’ve instead chosen to rework and

rebalance the dimensions of personality called the Big Five personality traits, a model

that is very popular in psychological and social research.


Our personality types are based on five independent spectrums, with all letters in

the type code (e.g. INFJ-A) referring to one of the two sides of the corresponding

spectrum. We’ll talk more about these concepts in the next chapter. This approach

has allowed us to achieve high test accuracy while also retaining the ability to define

and describe distinct personality types.


During the last few years, we have conducted more than 800 studies to uncover

trends and correlations between personality traits and various behaviors. Many of


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          8

these studies will be referenced in this profile, and additional information can be

found in our online Academy. Our goal is to give you access to our sources without

repeating ourselves or overwhelming you with information. If you are particularly

interested in a specific study or its statistical characteristics, please feel free to

contact us via our website, and we will do our best to provide additional information.


With that aside, let’s dig deeper into the five personality aspects!



                     Five Personality Aspects

            Mind: Introverted (I) vs. Extraverted (E)

The distinction between Introverts and Extraverts may be the oldest notion in the

history of personality theories. It has long been observed that some people are

expressive and outgoing, while others are reserved, quiet, and more comfortable

alone. The first group recharges by engaging with the external world and

communicating with other people, whereas members of the second group are

energized by spending time alone and connecting with their own inner world.


We focus on these differences in our first scale, which we call Mind. This scale – which

is based on a person’s level of expressiveness and the degree to which he or she

seeks external stimulation – determines how we see and approach the outside world,

including people, objects, and activities. This scale correlates with a number of other

personality traits, such as willingness to volunteer, desire to engage in thrill-seeking

activities, and romantic assertiveness, to name just a few.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          9
                                                                     The Puzzle of Personality


On one side of this scale, we have

Introverted individuals (the I letter in

the   type   acronym).    You     might

associate Introversion with being

private or withdrawn – or even

clumsy or antisocial – but our studies

show a far more complex picture.

Generally speaking, Introverts do

not seek or require much external stimulation. As you might expect, an Introvert

requires less communication with others than an Extravert would, but an Introvert’s

preference for less stimulation can also influence his or her hobbies, political

attitudes, and even eating or drinking habits. To give a practical example, our studies

have found that Introverts are less likely than Extraverts to enjoy coffee and energy

drinks.


                                                     But      what     about     Extraverts?

                                                     Compared          with       Introverts,

                                                     Extraverts are more interested in

                                                     engaging with the people, objects,

                                                     and environment around them. This

                                                     preference manifests itself in many

                                                     ways: Extraverts are less sensitive

                                                     than Introverts to noise, for example,

and they are likelier to wear bright and colorful clothes. Extraverts not only tolerate

external stimuli, however; they actually need these stimuli in order to support their

own energy.




                                “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                            10
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


Extraverts are often energetic and willing to take the lead, especially in social

situations. They enjoy pushing themselves to the limit and challenging themselves

and those around them. Unlike Introverts, who are more cautious in their approach,

Extraverts are likely to feel that they can handle life’s challenges without much

forethought. Whether that turns out to be true depends on many other

circumstances, but overall, Extraverts tend to be more proactive in experiencing –

and embracing – the world around them.


Worldwide, the three most Extraverted countries are Oman (61.66%), Yemen

(59.44%), and Saudi Arabia (58.95%). The most Introverted countries are Japan

(59.88%), Lithuania (55.85%), and Portugal (54.25%). In the United States, New York

(50.92%), Mississippi (50.87%), and Illinois (50.64%) top the list for Extraverts, while

West Virginia (53.62%), Alaska (53.6%), and Maine (53.41%) report the highest

percentages of Introverts. Interestingly, if the District of Columbia were included in

the comparisons, it would easily top the Extraverted list. In our study, the average

Extraversion score for the capital city’s 23,310 respondents was 53.06% – significantly

above New York, its closest competitor.


Protagonists are Extraverted – they tend feel recharged after spending time in the

company of other people, and consequently often have excellent social skills. As

Extraverts, Protagonists enjoy taking the lead and speaking their mind, often going

ahead and voicing their opinion as they develop it. People with this personality trait

tend to instinctively connect with others, regardless of their background or

personality, making them popular and well-liked in many circles.

                                                                 The Puzzle of Personality


             Energy: Intuitive (N) vs. Observant (S)

Energy is the second scale in our model, and in our opinion it is the most important.

While the other four scales determine how you interact with the world (Mind), make

decisions (Nature), schedule your activities (Tactics), or react to external feedback

(Identity), the Energy scale actually determines how you see the world and what kind

of information you focus on.


All personality types can be divided into those that favor the Intuitive energy style

and those that favor the Observant energy style. Intuitive individuals tend to be

visionary, interested in ideas and abstractions, and attracted to novelty. Observant

individuals, on the other hand, prefer facts, concrete and observable things, and the

tried and true.


It is important to stress that this scale has nothing to do with how we absorb

information: Intuitive and Observant types use their five senses equally well. Instead,

this scale shows whether we focus on what is possible (making connections intuitively)

or what is real (observing the environment). If you are familiar with the Big Five

personality traits, you might recognize this scale as a reworking of the openness to

experience concept, with a focus on preference for (and tolerance of) novelty and

ambiguity.


Individuals with the Intuitive trait rely on their imaginations and think in terms of

ideas and possibilities. They dream, fantasize, and question why things happen the

way they do, always feeling slightly detached from the actual, concrete world.

Although they observe other people and events, their minds remain directed both

inwards and somewhere beyond – always questioning, wondering, and making

                                                                  The Puzzle of Personality


connections. When all is said and

done, Intuitive types believe in

novelty, in the open mind, and in

never-ending improvement.


In one 16Personalities study, we

asked people whether they wish

they had been born in the Age of

Discovery (roughly speaking, the 15th

through the 18th centuries). Our results showed that Intuitive types were much more

willing to give up the convenience, comfort, and predictability of modern life in

exchange for the excitement of exploration, distant civilizations, and the

undiscovered mysteries of the New World.


                                                     In contrast, individuals with the

                                                     Observant trait focus on the actual

                                                     world and things happening around

                                                     them. Preferring to see, touch, feel,

                                                     and experience, they are happy to

                                                     leave theories and possibilities to

                                                     others. They keep their feet on the

                                                     ground and focus on the present,

instead of wondering why or when something might happen. Consequently, people

with this trait tend to be better at dealing with facts, tools, and concrete objects as

opposed to brainstorming, theorizing about future events, or handling abstract

theories. Observant types are also significantly better at focusing on just one thing

at a time instead of juggling multiple activities.



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           13

The Energy scale influences communication style as well. Intuitive individuals talk

about ideas and have no difficulties with allusions or reading between the lines, while

Observant types focus on facts and practical matters. This is why Intuitive types may

find it challenging to understand someone with the Observant trait, and vice versa.

Intuitive types may think that Observant individuals are materialistic, unimaginative,

and simplistic, and Observant types may see their Intuitive conversation partner as

impractical, naïve, and absent-minded. These assumptions and biases can be quite

damaging, and it takes a mature person to get past them.


Geographically, the Middle East and Asia have the largest percentage of Observant

individuals, with 8 countries in the top 10 list. Saudi Arabia (71.94%), Oman (71.03%),

and Yemen (69.76%) have the top scores among Observant countries, while Nepal

(48.92%), Albania (48.51%) and Maldives (48.44%) top the Intuitive table.


In the United States, North Dakota (59.43%), Minnesota (59.23%), and Iowa (59.04%)

are the most Observant states. On the opposite side of the table, we have Nevada

(43.92%), Rhode Island (43.75%), and West Virginia (43.47%).


Protagonists are Intuitive individuals. This is why they are so good at seeing

possibilities and honoring different points of view. People with this personality type

spend more time engaging in various internal discussions than observing things

around them. Protagonists are not that concerned about what is happening; instead,

they focus on what might happen or why something has happened. Protagonists

hone this focus throughout their lives, which makes them passionate and insightful

thinkers.


Of course, every stick has two ends, and focus on novelty and change comes at a cost.

By directing their mental resources toward possibilities and the future, Protagonists



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         14

inevitably lose sight of what is happening around them. They may have difficulties

dealing with practical matters or data. If they aren’t paying attention, they may even

miss something right under their nose. Because the majority of the population has

the Observant trait, Protagonists may have difficulty finding a partner and connecting

with others.



                 Nature: Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)

The third scale, which we call Nature, determines how we make decisions and cope

with emotions. While we all have feelings, there are significant differences in how

different types react to them. This scale influences a number of areas of our lives,

particularly our interactions with other people.


                                                    People with the Thinking trait seek

                                                    logic and rational arguments, relying

                                                    on their head rather than their heart.

                                                    They do their best to safeguard,

                                                    manage, and conceal their emotions.

                                                    “Whatever    happens,     you    must

                                                    always keep a cool head” – this is the

                                                    motto of Thinking individuals. These

types are not cold-blooded or indifferent, however. People with the Thinking trait are

often just as emotional as those with the Feeling trait, but they subdue or override

their feelings with their rational logic.


In several of our studies, we analyzed the attitudes of different personality types

toward philanthropy and charitable causes. Thinking types are significantly less likely

to engage in charitable giving or to be touched by charities’ emotional appeals. Does


                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          15
                                                                 The Puzzle of Personality


this mean that they are unwilling to help? Not necessarily. It turns out that Thinking

personalities don’t believe that giving money to charity is the best way to make a

difference. They may look for other ways to be of assistance – for example, investing

in education for the disadvantaged.


In contrast, people with the Feeling trait follow their hearts and care little about

hiding their emotions. From their perspective, we should not be afraid to listen to

our innermost feelings and share them with the world. These individuals tend to be

compassionate, sensitive, and highly emotional. They would rather cooperate than

compete, although they are not naïve or easily swayed.


In fact, people with the Feeling trait

are likely to fight tooth and nail for

their values and beliefs. For many

Feeling types, principles and ideals

are much more important than, say,

professional success. Although this

perspective might not seem rational,

Feeling types generally adhere to

their own highly individualized – and perfectly valid – logic.


Worldwide, Iran (51.91%), Georgia (50.74%), and Albania (48.94%) report highest

scores on the Thinking side of the scale. On the Feeling side, we have Singapore

(61.41%), Australia (60.1%), and New Zealand (59.98%).


In the U.S., northern states tend to be slightly more Feeling, but not significantly so.

One interesting example is the contrast between Utah and Nevada: two neighboring

states that are each first on opposite sides of the scale. In Utah, the average score is



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          16
                                                               The Puzzle of Personality


61.19% on the Feeling side, well above Minnesota (59.61%) and Idaho (59.54%), which

take second and third place, respectively. Nevada, on the other hand, is the most

Thinker-heavy state in our study, with its 34,576 respondents getting an average

score of 42.99% on the Thinking side of the spectrum. While that still means Feeling

personality types outnumber Thinking types significantly, we rarely see such

differences between neighboring regions. Other top Thinking states include

Delaware (42.71%) and New Mexico (42.7%).


Protagonists have the Feeling trait – they trust and prioritize feelings, relying on

moral and ethical arguments, and doing everything they can to stay true to their

deeply held principles. People with this personality type are kind and sensitive,

always able to find something positive regardless of the circumstances. The Intuitive

and Feeling traits form the core of the Protagonist personality, making them very

insightful, idealistic and open-minded individuals, capable of amazing feats,

especially in fields related to morality, philosophy or diplomacy. However, they also

push Protagonists away from the majority of the population, sometimes making it

difficult for them to relate to other people, especially when it comes to accepting

what they see as egoism and self-interest.



            Tactics: Judging (J) vs. Prospecting (P)

The Tactics scale determines how we approach planning and how we handle

available options. The implications reach well beyond our calendars, however. At its

core, this scale determines our attitudes toward certainty and structure in our lives.


People with the Judging trait do not like to keep their options open. They would rather

prepare five different contingency plans than wait for challenges to arise. These

individuals enjoy clarity and closure, always sticking to the plan rather than going


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         17

with the flow. It’s as if Judging types keep a mental checklist, and once a decision is

crossed off that list, it is not open to reassessment. This mentality applies as much

to grocery shopping as it does to life goals, like buying a house.


                                                   Individuals with the Judging trait

                                                   tend to have a strong work ethic,

                                                   putting      their    duties      and

                                                   responsibilities above all else. Our

                                                   research indicates that Judging types

                                                   are also strict when it comes to law

                                                   and order. Of course, this doesn’t

                                                   mean that Prospecting individuals

are lawbreakers, but if you see someone go out of his or her way to use a crosswalk,

that person is likely a Judging type.


In contrast, Prospecting individuals are flexible and relaxed when it comes to dealing

with both expected and unexpected challenges. They are always scanning for

opportunities and options, willing to jump at a moment’s notice. People with this trait

understand that life is full of possibilities, and they are reluctant to commit to

something that might prove an inferior option in the future. They also focus more on

what makes them happy than what

their    parents,      employers,   or

teachers expect. If a specific task is

not     particularly    important   or

interesting, a Prospecting individual

will always come up with something

better to do.



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          18

Looking at the geographical data, the global Judging-Prospecting chart has

interesting similarities with the Extraverted-Introverted one. While these scales do

not influence each other from a statistical perspective, many of the countries topping

the Extraverted-Introverted charts have correspondingly high Judging-Prospecting

scores. At the top of the Judging table we have Oman (58.05%), Yemen (57.78%), and

Kuwait (55.8%), while the most Prospecting countries are Japan (55.21%), Nepal

(53.74%), and Lithuania (53.62%).


The map of the United States, however, does not show significant overlaps between

these two scales. On the Judging side of the spectrum, we have South Carolina

(51.05%), Alabama (50.97%), and Tennessee (50.8%). On the other side, the most

Prospecting states are Alaska (51.2%), Vermont (50.86%), and West Virginia (50.76%).


Protagonists are Judging individuals – they are decisive and usually find it difficult to

cope with uncertainty and unpredictability. This is what makes them not just natural

visionaries, but also implementers, both willing and able to dedicate time to making

sure that their ideas come to life. That being said, people with this personality type

aren’t too meticulous or rule-bound – they seek closure, but don’t obsess over tiny

details or procedures. Protagonists are idea people rather than logisticians.

            Identity: Assertive (-A) vs. Turbulent (-T)

The last scale, Identity, affects all others, reflecting how confident we are in our

abilities and decisions. In a way, this scale acts as an internal sensor, reacting to the

input we get from our environments – for instance, success or failure, feedback from

others, or pressure caused by unexpected events. The Mind and Identity scales are

the alpha and the omega of our model, acting as an external shell that we wear in all

of our interactions with the outside world. Later, we will discuss the four possible

combinations of these traits, which we call “Strategies,” but in the meantime, let’s

                                                    take an in-depth look at the Identity

                                                    scale.


                                                    Assertive     individuals      are    self-

                                                    assured,          even-tempered,      and

                                                    resistant to stress. They refuse to

                                                    worry too much, and they don’t push

                                                    themselves too hard when it comes

                                                    to achieving goals. Similarly, they are

                                                    unlikely     to     spend    much     time

thinking about past actions or choices. According to Assertive types, what’s done is

done and there is little point in analyzing it. Not surprisingly, people with this trait are

generally satisfied with their lives, and they feel confident in their ability to handle

challenging and unexpected situations.


In contrast, Turbulent individuals are self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They

experience a wide range of emotions and tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic,

and eager to improve. Always feeling the need to do more, have more, and be more,




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                              20

Turbulent types may forget how

exhausting this dissatisfaction can

be – both for themselves and for the

people around them.


While the Assertive variant may

seem more positive on the surface,

that is not necessarily the case.

Turbulent    individuals   are   more

willing than Assertive types to change jobs if they feel stuck in their current roles, and

they think deeply about the direction of their lives. Turbulent individuals may also

outperform Assertive types in certain instances, because they may care more about

the outcome. The willingness of Turbulent types to push themselves may ultimately

enable them to achieve their goals.


Worldwide, Japan is by far the most Turbulent country, with an average score of 57.48%

on the Turbulent side. Italy (53.8%) and Brunei (52.89%) come in second and third,

respectively. On the Assertive side of the spectrum, we have Uganda (57.91%),

Barbados (57.11%), and Nigeria (57.01%).


In the United States, there is a clear east-west divide, with the East Coast being

significantly more Turbulent. West Virginia (49.3%) takes the lead on the Turbulent

side, followed by Rhode Island (48.84%) and Maine (48.73%). The most Assertive

states are New Mexico (54.7%), Colorado (54.66%), and Hawaii (54.28%).



                                 Type Groups
Now you know what each type consists of. But how do they fit together?

Our system has two layers: the first (inner) one defines our Roles, the second (outer)

one, our Strategies.



                                        Roles

The Role layer determines our goals, interests, and preferred activities. Each of the

four Roles covers a set of personality types that are very similar, and we will use these

groups later in this profile to draw contrasts and similarities between personalities.

They also serve to highlight the importance we have placed on the Energy trait. Each

personality type will share either the Observant or the Intuitive trait with all other

members of their group, as well as one other key trait. Protagonists belong to the

Diplomat Role group, along with three other personality types: Advocates, Mediators,

and Campaigners.


                                        Analysts

Shared traits: Intuitive and Thinking


The personality types in the Analyst Role – Architects, Logicians, Commanders, and

Debaters – embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological pursuits.

The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive trait lets them apply

their minds to almost anything, with their imaginations aiding calculated, strategic

thinking, or seeing just how far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought

experiment.


These personalities are driven to understand and create, and have no problem

switching between speculative musing and frank, solutions-oriented approaches to

whatever problems are at hand. Broad, intelligent vision gives Analysts an ingenious

                                                                 The Puzzle of Personality


air, but they can become overwhelmed and scattered if they don’t learn to hone

these abilities and use them to advance a worthwhile cause or project.


The biggest pitfall is that their intellect can give them a false sense of accomplishment.

They tend to prefer the world of ideas to the sober reality of follow-through, and by

assuming the role of critic instead of participant, Analysts sometimes risk being

functionally outpaced by those who simply sit down and do the work. They can earn

themselves the unsavory title of “armchair analysts” while those with more real-world

experience continue to create real results. Analyst personality types can lack a proper

respect for those of simpler vision and expression, whatever their background, and

it can hold them back.


Analysts value their intellect above all else, and it can be a challenge convincing them

it’s worth checking their many hypotheses with an experiment or proper evidence to

be sure. To many Analysts, if something makes sense in their minds, that’s as good

as proved, and a great deal faster. Analysts can be brilliant, but they’re still human;

under the influence of ego, these personality types can get in the habit of advancing

clever opinions instead of objective facts.


Analysts’ positive self-identity stems largely from their formidable drive to learn, and

their clever and sharply witty banter can make them excellent debate partners. Often

insatiable readers as well, Analysts can be found stockpiling books, questioning

teachers, and driving conversations in forums across the world wide web. These

types prefer their own processes and pace, and are energized by exercising their

minds on their own time.


Analysts are also relentless self-improvers. Once they’ve recognized a flaw, they

apply all of this cold rationality, honest reflection, imagination, and desire for results



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          23

to make it right. Analysts’ forceful, imaginative vision, when trained and focused,

enables these personalities to conceive and accomplish things most thought

impossible.


                                       Diplomats

Shared traits: Intuitive and Feeling


Diplomats – Advocates, Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners – tend to be warm,

caring, and generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These

personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord only as a

step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities seemingly go deeper than the

traditional senses – it’s as if they have a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can

resonate with people’s emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep

connections with others.


This is not as mystical as it can seem. Diplomat personalities deeply value

understanding, and a lifetime of self-reflection grants them insights into others’

motivations that they might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this

to shape the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use this for

ill.


Diplomats’ people skills nurture friendship and healing with pure, genuine empathy.

Causing distress feels to them like wounding their own psyche, so they prefer to

gently nudge loved ones and strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find

the ideals of humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth

warm them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types envision a

prismatic, kind world.

                                                               The Puzzle of Personality


The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes Diplomats

sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal world. They can be aggressive

against forces they perceive as evil, and are capable of steely action when they feel

they have moral high ground. Diplomats’ sensitive emotions may flare to outright

combativeness if provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these

personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump rationality

unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very causes they hold dear,

however justified the outrage.


Tempering this passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are

often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking in empathy,

and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They find greater satisfaction in

abstract self-exploration and understanding the issues that affect those least able to

defend themselves than mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks.

Diplomats emphasize experience and understanding rather than calculable

achievement.


Among friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring to

brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange of thoughts and

feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend themselves in this more

personal aspect of their lives as well – emotionally, physically, or even financially.

Diplomats’ open hearts make them vulnerable when others aren’t as considerate,

though they wouldn’t have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will

almost always be the volunteer.


Diplomats embrace travel as readily as anyone – they like exploring other cultures

and people’s colorful ways. These personality types are creatively inclined, often

practicing artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where others


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         25

see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive attitudes, they also

appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure expression of a way of thinking and being.

Diplomats can be passionately inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater,

nature, and anything else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their

eyes.


Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world around them with

progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel connected to forces they may

not fully understand, a deep sense of faith that may express itself, if not always

through traditional religion, as spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an

underlying idealism and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the

arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They have a conviction

to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible rewards felt in the heart and soul.


                                       Sentinels

Shared traits: Observant and Judging


Sentinels – Logisticians, Defenders, Executives, and Consuls – are cooperative and

practical. Their grounded approach helps them feel comfortable with who they are,

defining themselves not by individualism, but by character and competence. These

personality types seek order, security, and stability, and tend to work hard to

maintain the way of things, leading to a deserved reputation as the core of any group

or organization, from family to church to the office and the factory floor.


These types embrace teamwork, but expect the same performance and

respectability from others that they strive for themselves. Sentinels often dislike

strident nonconformity because they envision progress through collaboration and

hard work within a known set of rules – to let everyone do their own thing on a whim


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         26

would be anarchy. Sentinels prefer proven methods and honest accomplishment to

self-indulgent exploration and esoteric ideas. Because these personalities are deeply

prudent, they also tend to be self-motivated, and rarely need external inspiration to

be productive.


Their grounded perspective leaves little room for random musings, but Sentinels are

not unimaginative. They experiment for anticipated gain rather than intellectual

thrills, and excel in making challenging situations work. Revolution does not appeal

to people from this Role, who tend to learn from the past and remain loyal to the

tested truths and traditions they were brought up with. Where some see fascinating

philosophy, Sentinels may see preposterousness: these personality types favor

practiced methodology over abstract theory.


Having authority allows Sentinels to practice their virtues. Effective in leadership

roles, these types motivate others by energetic example and feel satisfaction from

guiding a well-functioning group – they tend to make excellent teachers, managers,

and community officials, as well as parents and hosts. These personalities are

meticulous and traditional, excelling in logistical and administrative fields with clear

hierarchies and rules as well. Opting for successful completion whenever they can,

Sentinels can be controlling, but gladly compromise when needed to get things done.


Sentinels feel rewarded by shepherding others, and enjoy coordinating and sharing

fun social experiences with friends and family. They believe it is their responsibility

to give their families safe, happy lives that prepare them for the real world. An

appreciation of strong relationships allows them to share generously with those they

respect and love – these types feel bolstered by having reliable people in their lives,

and will do what they can to make sure they hold up their end of the bargain.

Birthdays, dinner parties, and camping trips are delightful events under their

enthusiastic direction.


These personality types are happiest without drama, though their admirably

stubborn loyalty can certainly attract it if they feel they need to stand by a friend,

regardless of whether they’re in the right or wrong. Inconsistent people can test

Sentinels’ tolerance and provoke harsh judgement. Sentinels tend to prefer

predictability over novelty and familiar pleasures more than cutting-edge excitement.

It can be difficult for Sentinel personalities to accept people who lack their studious

ideals, but they often respond as engaged and caring mentors to those who wish to

grow in that direction.


                                     Explorers

Shared traits: Observant and Prospecting


Explorers – Virtuosos, Adventurers, Entrepreneurs, and Entertainers – possess a self-

reliant mix of enthusiasm, quick thinking, and ingenuity that can lead to impressive

personal and professional accomplishments. Comfortable with uncertainty and

minimally concerned with preparation, these personality types simply adapt and

overcome as events present themselves. Explorers’ flexibility helps them make snap

decisions in the moment, and they’re unlikely to dwell on the future or the past.


They aren’t obsessed with precise detail (unless they’re really in the zone, in which

case they can muster a level of precision and focus that would make a seasoned

engineer blush). Usually, they require workability rather than perfection. Explorer

personalities are utilitarian masters of diverse tools and techniques, ranging from

instruments and engines to the art of persuasion, and they distinguish themselves in

crises, crafts, and sales.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         28
                                                              The Puzzle of Personality


This versatile decisiveness doesn’t mean commitment, however. Explorers can

change their minds with minimal regret or second-guessing. People in this Role

dislike monotony, and often feel tempted to stray from obligations in favor of

entertaining new things. They experiment with many interests and live and breathe

whatever they connect with – for a time. If these personality types sometimes leave

business unfinished, let clutter build up, or misplace important things, it’s because

they’ve moved on to something fresh.


Explorers enjoy being free of obligations, where they can indulge themselves or their

interests on their own time. An Explorer might design and build their own dream

house, enthralled with the process, but end up procrastinating on simple repairs

after a few years. They are highly motivated when steering themselves through

something interesting, but don’t like being restrained by anything “mandatory.”


Their relaxed, free-form attitude makes Explorer personalities socially dynamic as

well. They often seek out people and experiences that cater to their senses, finding

more pleasure in stimulation than planning. They happily approach appealing

strangers and interesting experiences, and when things get in the way of a good time,

they apply their ingenuity to getting around it. Explorers want to see what happens

next!


The same themes run through their friendships and families, though these

relationships have much more staying power than most other interests. Rather than

forcing relationships into or out of existence though, Explorers let things flow

naturally according to their desires. Compatible people simply become a part of their

lives. These personality types tend to be individualistic and freedom-loving, going

their own way with little regard for naysayers, but they do enjoy knowing that the

people they trust will be around in the end.


                            “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         29

Explorers are highly spontaneous, connecting with and adapting to their

environment in a way that is almost childlike in its wonder and sheer fun. It can be a

challenge for them to work for things with a distant or unexciting payoff, as they need

a sense of immediacy to feel truly engaged, but when they are passionate, Explorer

personalities can move heaven and earth.



                                    Strategies

The Strategy layer reflects our preferred ways of doing things and achieving our goals.

There are four strategies: Confident Individualism, People Mastery, Constant

Improvement, and Social Engagement. Depending on their type variant, Protagonists

fall under either People Mastery (Assertive Protagonists) or Social Engagement

(Turbulent Protagonists).


                            Confident Individualism

Shared traits: Introverted and Assertive


Confident Individualists typically trust in themselves, and they often embrace

solitude to pursue their own interests rather than seeking out social activity.

Fascinated by personal projects, people following this Strategy often have an

impressive range of skills and interesting ideas. But projects are usually only pursued

for their own merit – Confident Individualists tend to feel that social displays and

bragging are time and energy wasted. These personality types are proud of who they

are, what they know, and what they can do, but they don’t feel the need to prove

themselves to others.


Confident Individualists engage their internal inspiration instead of searching for

motivation outside themselves. They favor privacy, and aren’t particularly fond of


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         30
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


interacting with society, whether in a strictly social sense or when embracing broader

societal goals. These personalities often favor substance over superficiality and

personal honesty over playing along, and prefer a utilitarian approach, even when

pursuing esoteric goals.


This utilitarianism also means that Confident Individualists are not easily drawn into

emotional drama. They hold their own opinions firmly, but tend to see little reason

to try to convince others. When drama does arise, these personality types express

their truth with little concern over whether they’ll cause friction or offense. Confident

Individualists tend to endorse self-reliance over cooperation, and are rarely

pressured into agreeing with or lending support to others unless they believe in the

cause.


This relaxed self-assurance means that Confident Individualists may not push their

boundaries. Their live-and-let-live attitude goes both ways: they don’t need to

convince others, and they tend to expect others to return the favor. While highly

capable, they can miss information and opportunities that challenge their views

because they simply don’t place much importance on factoring in others’ approval.

They can be tolerant in disagreement though, respecting others’ individualism just

as they respect their own.


When these personality types form friendships, they tend to be strong and honest.

Because these types don’t feel like they need other people’s approval, their loyalty

and affection is a deliberate expression of affection. Impressing a Confident

Individualist earns their respect and care, and these types make for dedicated,

passionate friends.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         31
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


Self-reliance is central for these types, and they handle difficult situations well

because they tend to be emotionally secure, bold, and resistant to stress. They rarely

seek leadership or the spotlight, but when they do find themselves in these positions,

these personalities lead by an example of self-determination and uncomplicated

honesty – they appreciate grace, class, and form, and rarely seek to impress by

appearances alone. When acting with knowledge and wisdom, Confident

Individualists can be noble pillars of strength.


                                  People Mastery

Shared traits: Extraverted and Assertive


People Masters are highly stress-resistant, maintaining confidence through life’s

challenges, social pressures, and any questions of their capabilities. These

personality types seek social contact and have solid communication skills, feeling at

ease when relying on or directing other people. People Masters’ mantra is fearless

engagement – to be is to do. This is not a group known for its timid opinions or

idleness.


People Masters feel rewarded by stimulation and challenging experiences. They like

travelling to see things, people, and places, where they can experience a richer

understanding of the world around them. These personalities like sampling new

foods, lifestyles, and cultures; even things they don’t end up liking can be entertaining

excitement for them.


Sometimes, though, People Masters are too confident. Insulated against self-doubt

and the need to prove themselves, they don’t always test, or even consider, their own

limits or ambitions. They can slip into a pattern of endless fun and comfort-seeking,

rolling their eyes at those who press themselves towards more intimidating goals. At


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         32
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


the other end of the spectrum, these personality types can just as easily ignore

sensible caution, putting themselves in extraordinary and dangerous situations,

confident they can find their way through.


Most fall somewhere in the middle, embracing healthy ambition and competition so

long as they play a meaningful part in social circles and leadership. Social interaction

plays a big part in People Masters’ happiness. While not dependent on people’s

approval for emotional security, they appreciate acclaim for their accomplishments

and bright personalities, and can be a touch showy from time to time. These types

are self-confident, but they are often lost without people to lead, laugh with, and love.


Their charisma, self-assurance and boisterousness can sometimes be trying qualities.

People Masters prefer cooperation, but have few qualms about dominating their

opposition to achieve their goals, boldly promoting themselves and using their social

skills to get ahead. This Strategy understands people’s needs, but can just as easily

use this as a weapon rather than a tool of compassion if they have their sights set on

something big.


People Masters can compromise when needed, but these personality types tend to

be better talkers than listeners. They can be very demanding, criticizing people’s

performance regardless of their feelings because they expect no less of themselves.

That said, these types are moderate in their disagreements because their ego and

confidence aren’t at stake the way they often are for Turbulent Strategies. People

Masters are not fond of grudges, content to let bygones be bygones. They are more

likely to be socially idealistic, with the intent of bringing people together to make

things happen – petty grievances just get in the way.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         33
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


People Masters’ charismatic virtues shine in social contexts, and these types have

little fear of rejection and a passion for inclusion. They prefer to take the lead, but

sharing the journey through other people’s eyes enhances their own enjoyment as

well. People Masters share in all aspects of people’s lives, making these personalities

strong, honest friends, parents, spouses, and colleagues, serving as wellsprings of

energy, joy, and mutual success.


                            Constant Improvement

Shared traits: Introverted and Turbulent


Constant Improvers are sensitive and contemplative individuals who enjoy having

their own space and freedom. They are often deep and creative individuals, though

often tense and more comfortable on their own than mixed up in the judgment of

the real world. With the two personality traits most representative of a sensitivity to

their environment – Introversion and Turbulence – they are reserved when dealing

with strangers or new situations, often turning inwards or focusing on peacekeeping

instead.


These personalities’ caution in the face of unfamiliar challenges can sometimes look

like a lack of motivation, but this is usually just self-doubt – Constant Improvers have

a strong drive, but it comes paired with a strong fear of failure. They invest a great

deal of their identity in their successes, and even a minor misstep or embarrassment

can be crushing.


The vigilance learned from a lifetime of ups and downs gives these personality types

a knack for sensing trouble. This is a strategic wariness that can be quite useful in

situations that need to balance risk and reward, whether a financial investment or a

romantic opportunity. Though they can seem frustratingly over-cautious to others,


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          34
                                                                 The Puzzle of Personality


Constant Improvers would rather not face calamity, so they excel at avoiding it with

preventive insights.


Since they aren’t always comfortable with energetic exchanges with other people,

Constant Improvers often direct their attention elsewhere, striving to master hobbies,

careers, bodies of knowledge, or new means of self-expression. Their restless drive,

self-doubt, and solitary mentality can combine to create impressive, beautiful results.


High-achieving and perfectionistic, Constant Improvers generally try to do their best

in their endeavors, dedicating tremendous time and energy. These personalities can

put so much pressure on themselves that they diminish their own impressive

accomplishments by fixating on the slightest flaws or dismissing successes as luck

rather than skill or dedication.


Taken too far, this perfectionism can also drive endless rumination – an unhealthy

obsession with perfection will reveal flaws in the best plans, and Constant Improvers

often feel forced to abandon a course of action because something doesn’t line up

right. Whether working feverishly or picking at the threads of an idea though,

Constant Improvers can be intense about their goals, and progress towards internal

balance can lead them to amazing personal accomplishments.


Alongside their personal efforts, these personality types also care a great deal what

others think of them. This can be very useful, but they can take this to a fault: fixating

on others’ expectations can sour social efforts into awkwardness. Constant

Improvers are easily thrown off-balance by conflict, and may communicate timidly,

or not at all, for fear of hurting people’s feelings, provoking a confrontation, or

looking the fool.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          35
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


Sometimes it takes peer approval and active encouragement for this Strategy group

to recognize their own virtues. These personalities often benefit from friends and

colleagues patient enough to get to know them and who give them a chance to speak

their minds. When treated considerately, these types become devoted partners and

begin to reveal their kindness, insights, heartfelt support, and the complexities of

their approach to the world, from sometimes (oddly specific) plans for obscure

situations to starry-eyed ambitions.


                               Social Engagement

Shared traits: Extraverted and Turbulent


Those with the Social Engagement Strategy are an interesting group. In some ways,

Extraversion and Turbulence conflict with each other: Extraversion leads to risk-

tolerance and boldness; Turbulence reflects self-doubt and sensitivity. Turbulence

also contributes to impulsivity, which Extraversion makes highly visible. This means

Social Engagers tend to do what comes naturally first and think about it later. In this

way, they are almost an exaggeration of their underlying personality types. This isn’t

a bad thing.


Social Engagers enthusiastically engage the external world, not content to live in their

minds, drawing emotional security from positive interactions. In business and among

loved ones, these types are usually the center of attention. Social Engagers meet the

needs of the crowd in social settings, but they sometimes hide their true selves to

impress other people. They appreciate social status, and often portray themselves

as the person they aspire to – usually a purer form of their personality type – in order

to achieve it.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          36
                                                                  The Puzzle of Personality


Social Engagers often experience stunning highs and lows as their Extraversion

pushes their Turbulent need for success into overdrive and their Turbulence creates

an immediate sense of regret, warranted or not. These personality types can be

surprisingly competitive, measuring themselves against peers and hoping others

notice their accomplishments, then retreat, suddenly becoming averse to conflict,

leading them to apologize for or avoid confrontations – even those that ended in

beneficial discussions.


These personalities may falter occasionally in their self-confidence, but ultimately

they are driven to improve and achieve. At the end of the day, they have no trouble

blowing off some steam and enjoying a much-needed break, either. Social Engagers

enthusiastically pursue stimulating and exciting experiences, especially with a group

of friends. They much prefer to dive into an experience than to sit down for a

reserved evaluation, though many will naturally regret their hot-headed lack of

planning down the road.


This push and pull between ambition and alarm, impulse and caution, highs and lows

can itself be quite stressful, but it’s all part of this Strategy’s charm. These personality

types are often restless in pursuit of their goals to improve their circumstances, but

show their passion by indulging their desires through some earned fun (and maybe

shopping for something impressive). Social Engagers work hard at their personal and

professional development, striving to meet all manner of stringent standards, but

they lead dynamic lives as well, filled with companionship, sharing adventures and

accomplishments with others whenever possible. Whatever direction they pull, they

are sure to pull the crowd with them.


While the Strategies are important, this series of e-books simply doesn’t have the

space to explore them properly. For now, we’ll focus on the inner core: The four Roles.

                   Who Is “The Protagonist?”




Throughout this book, we’ll discuss how Protagonists’ traits manifest themselves into

a complete personality type. Every type has their own way of expressing traits,

resulting in unique interplays that can be quite different from other types, even if

they have many traits in common. We’ll look at Protagonists’ own way of living life in

terms of personal growth, platonic and romantic relationships, parenting, and

academic and professional development. The following paragraphs are but a brief

overview of the Protagonist personality type – these areas will be explored in much

greater detail in subsequent chapters.


                                   Personal Growth


Although the art of delegation is not lost on Protagonists, few feel comfortable

behind the scenes. They generally prefer to roll up their sleeves and work as hard –

or harder – than anyone else to accomplish their goals. Their dedication to a cause is

obvious, an inspiration that serves to rally others in the face of setbacks both great

and small. People with this personality type also love to mentor and elevate others,

sharing whatever knowledge and skills they have cultivated to try and move



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         39
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


humanity forward as a group.


Of course, being so capable and outgoing can have a downside – Protagonists often

flirt with arrogance and bossiness as they encourage everyone to join them in striving

to become the best possible versions of themselves. They also can be somewhat

resistant to contrasting views; they adhere to a strict code, having decided on what

they see as an ideal path, so they aren’t often comfortable with anything that goes

against that choice.


Anyone who challenges Protagonists’ firm, idealistic beliefs may find themselves the

subject of pressure, which is intended to be beneficial. Protagonists sometimes carry

their sincere desire to help people too far, resulting in controlling behavior as they

try to “fix” others. Protagonists tend to be self-righteous, especially toward those who

differ from them in fundamental ways.


However, even if they can sometimes be like powerful trains, Protagonists are not

immovable, as they are always seeking to improve themselves and gain knowledge.

When someone gets past their willful opinions with solid facts or a truly brilliant idea,

they are fully capable of reorienting themselves to a new, better track. They are

determined to be right, even if it means admitting that they are wrong. This dynamic

ability is one of their greatest gifts, and it helps prevent their views from becoming

stale.


                           Friends, Family, and Relationships


Protagonists have a charismatic manner that’s connected to a sincere belief in the

value of people, as well as a ready willingness to give of their own energy. If they get

a little bossy, it’s often because they care deeply about others. The hope that

Protagonists have for humanity is not simply an abstract philosophical virtue, but an


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         40
                                                                The Puzzle of Personality


actively lived experience. Every person they meet is a delightful mystery they cannot

wait to unveil. Protagonists possess a forthright compassion and scrupulousness

that can disarm even the staunchest detractors, and those qualities help them win

people over as friends.


Of course, their social abilities extend to romantic interests, as well. Their overt

friendliness can be a bit of a shock at first, so energetic that it can make people

wonder whether they are sincere. However, the emotional connections they

establish eliminate such doubts, and people become smitten by not only their warm

energy, but also their depth. Whether with friends or a lover, Protagonists love the

feeling of being honestly connected – it’s a natural and sincere process.


Their connectedness also makes Protagonists deeply caring parents, boldly

determined to create well-being and growth in their children. Seeing those they care

for excel and prosper are among the most rewarding things they can experience,

especially when they feel as though they’ve had a hand in that development.


                       Academic and Professional Development


Their desire for positive involvement with others helps Protagonists achieve great

things in the classroom and on the job, as their forthright attitude opens doors. Their

bold charisma gives them confidence with social aspects of work or school, though

their enthusiasm can sometimes falter without people around to energize them.

Whereas many might struggle to focus on tasks due to social stress, Protagonists

thrive among peers rather than in solitude.


Fervor has a downside though, and Protagonists are not without their vulnerabilities

and limits. For this highly driven, idealistic type, anything less than complete success

can feel like frustrating failure. In response, they may push themselves too hard.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          41

When their own imaginative visions are simply out of the realm of possibility and

they become increasingly stubborn, they can grind themselves down.


For Protagonists, no evil is too great that it cannot be overcome by vigorous and

steadfast opposition, which they’re eager participate in and lead. When they find

themselves disagreeing with those who believe differently, they can become

embroiled in interpersonal struggles. They’re just as likely to win hearts over though,

stepping forward to change people’s minds for the better through their own inspired

vision.


                                    On That Note …


This introduction has provided only a brief outline of Protagonists’ potential

strengths and weaknesses. The following chapters discuss these topics in much

greater detail and provide further information as well suggestions for improvement.

Personal growth is not just a chapter in this book, it’s a mission woven into every part

of Protagonists’ lives. Through self-understanding, people can overcome and

rebalance behaviors that aren’t productive – or pleasant. Delving into personality

type is incredibly valuable to this end, and the following information will prove useful.

                                 Built on a Foundation


Personal development is supreme for Protagonists, as it is with all Diplomats. Their

devotion to growth starts with themselves and then extends to those around them.

As Intuitive Extraverts, both their internally based values and their outward sharing

of those values transform them into their best selves. Their development, in many

ways, rests on others. Navel-gazing alone is likely to bore these gregarious folks and

leave them feeling unchallenged. However, they still need to attend to their inner

lives if they are to grow.


This means that people with this personality type are both creative and reactive in

their development. They form their convictions and look to the world to interpret

what their ideals mean for their lives. While not natural sticklers for measurable

results, they need to sense that what they do has a real impact beyond theory and

beliefs, or their principles mean little. Although not necessarily tied to how others

use what they bring to the table, Protagonists are, nonetheless, concerned with

others’ responses. When the creative and the reactive balance, they’re likely to feel

fulfilled.


Their dependence on feedback means they must pay attention to their effectiveness

on some level, making Protagonists more strategic and analytical than might be

assumed. They employ a kind of rationality that, on the surface, mimics those with a

more pronounced Thinking trait; however, they still ground their decisions in

morality and harmony, and their view of growth is likely to reflect a heartfelt need to

behave altruistically. When it all works together, these types exhibit true wisdom.


                                 Message of a Mentor


People with the Protagonist personality type are warm individuals who don’t have

any trouble inspiring other people or getting them to listen. They’re passionate and

strong-willed, and they quickly grasp the big picture, which they transform into a

teachable moment whenever possible. They’re on a life mission to spread whichever

message appeals to them both in word and deed, and they find in that mission their

impetus for growth. Whether or not they formally hold a title like “leader” or

“teacher,” people with this personality type experience and foster their growth most

when they find ways to share their wisdom with the world.


Their rare combination of intuition, sustained focus, and social skills means

Protagonists may reach impressive heights in their chosen careers. Barack Obama,

the 44th President of the United States, exhibits Protagonist traits: Many compare

his style of explaining national concerns to that of a professor lecturing to students

about nuances, intricacies, and shared values that require consideration. He often

closes his speeches with a call to embrace an attitude or to take an action. Not every

                                                                          Personal Growth


Protagonist is a professor or president, but they often find themselves mentoring

others throughout their lives.


Although these types are mostly outgoing and enjoy leading from the front of the

room, they can also play a subtler part when sharing their values. One Protagonist

might be a soulful, charismatic friend whose insights on personal matters draw in

advice-seekers. Another might manage a soup kitchen and provide casual yet

inspirational counseling while ladling beef stew into the bowls of hungry clients. A

Protagonist corporate middle manager working in commerce may establish a

reputation by understanding that good customer service is a kind of ethical behavior.


People with this personality type can take countless paths and still express their basic

temperament. But no matter how they choose to go through life, their sense of

growth depends on actively imparting their values and ideals to others.



                Motivation and Development
The following qualities describe components necessary to Protagonists’ growth. The

first three are motivational, reflective qualities, and fulfilling them fuels their efforts

toward finding a more satisfying life by answering “why” questions. The final two are

more tactical, proactive, more focused on “how.”


                                   Reflective Qualities


These qualities involve the motivational self-awareness that Protagonists must

continue to nurture in order be happy, productive, and fulfilled:

                                                                        Personal Growth


   •   Self-esteem speaks to Protagonists’ sense of worth. They find their sense of

       worth in not only how they express compassion, but also how they spread it

       and recruit others to their missions in life.

   •   Self-respect speaks to how much they like themselves. Protagonists like

       themselves best when they do good for others.

   •   Self-confidence is the source of energy that propels Protagonists forward in

       life. For this type, confidence comes from knowing that their actions are

       products of their genuine selves.


                                 Development Strategies


These qualities speak to Protagonists’ more active aspects of personal growth:


   •   Self-evolution describes the personal growth process these types engage in

       to fully develop their potential. It involves methods and tactics to satisfy their

       self-esteem, self-respect, and self-confidence needs.

   •   Self-responsibility is Protagonists’ ability to take charge of their decisions and

       consequences without being dependent on others or accepting all that

       happens as fate. When they attribute their actions honestly, they can accept

       credit and blame with integrity, and they know what they can control and what

       they can’t.


To meet their self-esteem, self-respect, and self-confidence needs, Protagonists must

take a responsible approach to life and develop their core strengths and interests.

When they meet these needs, the result, by definition, is a significant and happy life.

However, if they don’t satisfy these needs, they can face overwhelming difficulty as

they try to improve their self-esteem.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         46

When Protagonists feel a lack of self-confidence, they can overcompensate with

superficial behaviors that mimic real confidence, resulting in displays of bluster and

pushiness – a far departure from their usual egalitarian approach. Because all the

qualities discussed here are interdependent and overlap in many places, a disruption

in one area easily disrupts others.


In the following sections, we will first discuss the characteristics of Protagonists in

their ideal, balanced, and fully developed form. When these motivational aspects are

used in a balanced way, they can help Protagonists lead fulfilling, productive, and

happy lives.


Then we will describe the tendencies that emerge if these aspects become

unbalanced. These represent departures from healthy, productive motivational

strategies, leading to adverse effects when Protagonists are disconnected from their

true selves.


Finally, we will discuss what can be done to improve balance in each of the

motivational aspects and ways to address potential barriers to balance. Exercises

and tips will be included to provide support, as well as concrete actions to rebalance

their personal growth and development.



                                 Self-Esteem

Self-esteem is a sense of self-worth, and Protagonists create their sense of worth by

exercising compassion. When Protagonists are nurturing their self-esteem, they deal

in interpersonal relationships that are much deeper than mere social connections –

some may even say they forge spiritual links with others. When assuming their




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        47
                                                                       Personal Growth


teacher or leader roles, Protagonists at their best share their compassion by inspiring

people to embrace their own growth and to live better lives.


                                 Balanced Self-Esteem

                           Building Connections and Seeking Purpose


Protagonists need to exercise empathy to feel they’re fulfilling their purpose. These

Extraverts specialize in big-picture causes that affect groups rather than individuals,

but they also excel in one-on-one connections when necessary. Protagonists often

work in helping or teaching professions where they can readily express their

compassion and enjoy a sense of community.


Their creativity and empathy help these types put a unique, personal spin on what

they share with others. Although they can build a compassionate message from

straightforward facts and ideas, they’re just as likely to use a compelling narrative to

inspire their listeners.


For Protagonists, compassion goes beyond simply “getting the job done.” When

providing a solution to someone’s problem, they may offer unorthodox suggestions

that deeply affect the person they’re helping. These types will nudge others to greater

heights to revolutionize their lives. When their compassionate acts are creative and

groundbreaking undertakings rather than “just helping,” Protagonists feel

invigorated.


                                  Mentoring as Compassion


Protagonists can content themselves without an official leadership label, but their

combination of imagination, compassionate sociability, and ability to organize often

manifests as a “take-charge” attitude. Their leadership style is inspirational, and


                                 “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     48
                                                                     Personal Growth


though they’re more likely to express it as a subtle influence rather than barked

orders, the effect is no less compelling.


People with this personality type place tremendous value on mentoring – working

closely to teach individuals gives these types a sense of value second only to their

creative approach to compassion, and they intertwine compassion so tightly with

leadership that they’re unlikely to distinguish them as separate.


Any type can fall under the seductive allure of power. Protagonists, however, are

more egalitarian than most types, and they can feel uncomfortable with too

prominent a position in any hierarchy. They find peace as the head of a group only

when they feel they are there to help pull others up to their level. If a position

demands an authoritarian relationship to other group members, Protagonists are

likely to abandon the role – or change it. Power is meaningless to them if they can’t

share its benefit with other people.


                           Unbalanced Self-Esteem

                                  Theatrical Empathy


To compensate for a flagging sense of self-esteem, Protagonists can smother others

by identifying too closely with their emotions and problems – and being too

aggressive about offering solutions. Typically, they prefer to help others live their

own lives and grow in their own unique ways. But if their own self-esteem is lacking,

they may see the stakes as high and apply pressure rather than provide gentle

guidance, in the hope of proving themselves. Rather than lending a hand, they may

take over.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      49
                                                                         Personal Growth


Those who find themselves on this wayward path may become performers on the

stage of various altruistic dramas. To puff themselves up, they might insist that their

way is the only way out of a shared dilemma. They may try to solve problems with

cleverness alone. For a while, they may not realize that their zeal serves their own

sense of importance more than it serves the needs of other people. However, when

this idea eventually catches up to them – and it likely will – they may feel like a fraud,

consequently experiencing a crisis of self-confidence.


                                  The Sacrificed Leader


Protagonists’ ideals can also tip them off-balance in the other direction. If they

embrace their role as that of a servant, as idealistic leaders often do, they can take

subservience too far. When their value and purpose need bolstering for whatever

reason, they can amp up their sacrificial mindset and forget to compensate with self-

care.


Healthy sacrifice as a leader doesn’t mean becoming weak and exhausted. Once

these types take on too much and exhaust their physical, emotional, and mental

reserves, their reputation as leaders can diminish. Because signaling leadership with

sacrifice can lessen their leadership capabilities, they may find that the very behavior

meant to bolster their self-esteem hurts it instead.


                           Rebalancing Self-Esteem

                                     Eye on the Prize


When self-esteem becomes unbalanced, Protagonists may try to cover substance

with style, causing them to become something they dislike: inauthentic. To restore




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          50
                                                                          Personal Growth


self-esteem, they need to return to making heartfelt contributions instead of putting

on a show to prove how compassionate they are.


The first step to rebalancing can be to refocus on that which gives Protagonists their

sense of value. Although their charismatic flair can be their flashiest asset, their

enthusiasm, leadership, and cleverness don’t define this personality type’s worth –

they build their self-esteem through how they use these assets to change the world.

Anchoring themselves to their purpose, rather than their talents, helps them restore

a sense of what they’re all about.


This may take some time for reflection, and they may want to step out of the spotlight

for a while.


One way to do this may involve planning a private retreat to create a mission

statement:


   •   Carve out a time and a place to simply be alone. Depending on

       circumstances, it can be hours or days.

   •   In writing, describe your purpose. It can be uncomplicated and declarative,

       and it requires little or no explanation – even a list of values, ideas, or

       important parts of life will do.

   •   Spend time doing something physical – paint a picture, do yoga, hike, go

       canoeing, play a musical instrument, shoot baskets, chop wood – anything

       that requires movement without a lot of complex thinking or decision-

       making. A lot of introspection happens when Protagonists aren’t trying.

   •   Complete the retreat by spending up to 15 minutes writing a brief mission

       statement. An ideal mission statement is simple and coherent; someone else

       could casually read it and understand.



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         51
                                                                       Personal Growth


Because Protagonists continuously experience empathy and look for ways to help

others, they may think there is no reason to codify their “mission.” But such a mission

statement, written down and available, may be exactly what’s needed when life’s

storms strike. Like a lighthouse’s beam cutting through the fog, a guiding statement

can illumine the proper course for Protagonists.


                                  Even Leaders Sleep


Protagonists who feel duty-bound to serve others can learn to both give and take

without diminishing either activity. The obvious antidote to burnout from self-

sacrifice is self-care: This means putting one’s own needs first, at least temporarily.

Finding time to nurture the body, mind, and soul is essential for everyone, especially

those who give as much as Protagonists.


Taking time away from helping others may feel selfish or callous when there are so

many needs in the world and so little time, but occasional breaks are not selfish. In

fact, self-nurturing and periods of restoration are essential to their future efforts.

Such efforts elevate Protagonists’ effectiveness to benefit other people, which, in

turn, has a strong influence on Protagonists’ self-esteem.


Self-care means getting enough sleep, eating well, cultivating personal relationships,

exercising, and having fun. The following exercise starts with fun and can help

Protagonists rebalance their approach to self-care:


   •   Take a deep breath. Breathing is always a great way to start self-care.

   •   Think of a fun activity from your past that you haven’t enjoyed recently. Avoid

       old hobbies you abandoned or lost interest in; instead, consider activities you

       wouldn’t normally make time for, maybe something fun you’ve never tried




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        52
                                                                        Personal Growth


       before. You might consider bowling, trying karaoke, water skiing, or going to

       a movie.

   •   Set a time and date to partake in the fun activity. Plan for the best possible

       version of your good time: Give yourself the time and space to do things how

       you want. If you want, invite someone along – just remember, this is for you!

   •   Let the fun experience set the tone for a while afterward. Use the memory of

       it to lighten up when things get heavy.


Having fun is just the start, though. It’s essential for Protagonists to find time for

themselves, even if it means designating it on their calendars. Eating, sleeping, loving,

living, and having fun contribute to a healthy lifestyle and, ultimately, a productive

one.



                                  Self-Respect

Protagonists who have self-respect are simply people who like themselves. When

self-respect is healthy, they don’t fear looking in the metaphorical mirror because

they like what they see. People who like themselves are happier and more satisfied

with their lives. They’re also likely to care for themselves better and make smarter

life choices. People do more for those they like and tend to treat them better; the

same principle applies to liking oneself.


                             Balanced Self-Respect

                                   Standing for Good


Protagonists like themselves best when they’re doing good for others, but it’s much

more than performing simple good deeds. These types live in a world of ideas and

visions that reflect their need to make the world a better place. For them, virtuous


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           53
                                                                       Personal Growth


missions rest on an ideological base, depending on circumstances in only a

secondary fashion. Their principles rule. When everything comes together, and they

help others according to those inner principles, Protagonists boost their positive self-

regard.


People with this personality type want to be a caring, impactful force in their world,

and their mental mirrors reflect something positive when they find ways to do so.

Nonetheless, it would be wrong to depict Protagonists as one-dimensional – not all

of them want to sacrifice everything for a cause. Some of them live quite normal lives;

taking their kids to Little League, going out to dinner with friends, and enjoying other

pedestrian pleasures and experiences. Some Protagonists use their altruistic

impulses to change the world, and some use them to change the neighborhood.


Protagonists who balance their lives understand there is more to their existence than

their work. They have other features to like about themselves – features that

complement their unselfish deeds yet extend beyond them. Sometimes inspiration

comes from living well. Altruism is valuable, but life gets its meaning from many

places – Protagonists who live that truth set a wholesome example for the people

who look to them with respect. These exemplary Protagonists have intimate

relationships, find time for rest and restoration, and spend time alone with their

thoughts occasionally. This balance makes Protagonists effortlessly likeable.


                                Standing with Charisma


When meeting their purpose in life is the basis of their self-esteem, Protagonists’

outgoing nature and charisma play a big part. Protagonists can take rightful pride in

their skillful ability to impress and persuade others. They can inspire and motivate




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         54
                                                                           Personal Growth


others to follow their lead toward achieving idealistic goals. Their enthusiasm is

mesmerizing, and they have no problem attracting others to their cause.


Saving the world – or at least their small corner of it – isn’t a lone effort, and

Protagonists are more at home gathering groups than they are motivating

individuals (although they do both in ample quantities). Competent recruiters and

leaders need persuasive talents, and Protagonists are likely to see their effectiveness

in swaying others as a primary way to enjoy self-respect.


                            Unbalanced Self-Respect

                                Identities and Expectations


Some Protagonists can take ownership of beliefs, causes, issues, or projects to the

point where their identity feels dependent on them. What they like about themselves

may be less about their inherent qualities and more about the pursuits to which they

dedicate themselves. Committed and strong-willed, they intensely invest themselves

and treat their passions as callings worthy of great time and effort. If they over-

identify with their undertakings, their self-assessment can hinge on matters over

which they have little control. In such cases, if outside forces hinder or challenge their

pursuits, it can severely affect their self-respect, especially if the disruption feels like

a failure.


Few can meet Protagonists’ high expectations, including themselves at times. Some

struggle to accept both their own and other people’s weaknesses. They may fantasize

about helping marginalized groups who are poor and oppressed but expect a lot out

of everyone in the process. Inspiring and encouraging people often is easy for

Protagonists, but they tend to expect a revolution overnight. They sometimes forget

that their own appetite for change comes from lengthy consideration, whereas the


                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           55
                                                                          Personal Growth


people they’re inspiring are experiencing a new possibility. The discrepancy can make

Protagonists feel like failures when success takes time, leading to wounded self-

respect.


                                     Unwanted Help


When they feel good about themselves, their good works flow naturally as they

advance through their lives. However, Protagonists who depend on their deeds as

fuel for self-respect can defy their natures by pushing others to receive their help.

But other people must want help before interventions can be helpful; some

Protagonists, especially those whose mental self-image isn’t so positive, may try to

boost their self-respect by forcing their help on others.


The unfortunate consequence of forcing such unwanted help is that Protagonists do

the opposite of what they intend. Instead of helping others find their own path to

growth, happiness, or wellness, they push them onto the potentially wrong path.

Although their need to feel better about themselves may blind them at first,

Protagonists’ characteristic insight eventually makes itself known. They may realize

they lost sight of some important personal standards, then admit that, on some level,

they focused on their own needs more than on the needs of others.


                           Rebalancing Self-Respect

                            Matching Expectations to Reality


Protagonists’ towering expectations can lead to constant disappointment. However,

telling these idealistic types to “be realistic” or to “lower their expectations” typically

fails to resonate. Putting altruistic ambitions into a more practical context may be

challenging for a type that expects a lot of themselves, but it’s often necessary for



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           56
                                                                       Personal Growth


rebalancing their self-respect. If every undertaking feels like a failure, it’s hard to

appreciate the effort. Protagonists need to recognize that sometimes their lofty

visions set them up for disappointment.


Discouragement from lack of progress, as well as pushback from other people, can

compound the problem for Protagonists. High expectations that aren’t met can also

create a need to control the uncontrollable: Rather than face the pain of more

disappointment, these types may try to force success. Learning to do their best, and

then let go of the rest, can help them break the cycle of harmfully blaming themselves

when missions become stalled or never realized at all.


Here are some steps Protagonists can take to practice letting go of things that aren’t

helpful or edifying:


   •   Find three material things to get rid of. Perhaps they haven’t been used in the

       past year. Perhaps they’re no longer useful or interesting.

   •   Rid yourself of the three things in a permanent way: Give them away to a friend

       or neighbor, donate them, or dispose of them in the trash.

   •   After getting rid of the things, consider what it means to no longer have them.


The same concept applies to less material things, such as ideas, memories, or

emotions, that might linger long after they serve their purpose. Considering how

things help them – or don’t –helps Protagonists know when they can move on without

them. Learning to let go can be a cleansing experience that helps Protagonists on

physical, mental, and spiritual levels.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       57
                                                                       Personal Growth


                                   Gaining a Clear Vision


Protagonists who force their help onto other people risk violating boundaries and

upsetting relationships, so it’s important for these types to uphold a clear vision of

their direction and to follow it with integrity. For this personality type, that means

helping other people on their own paths toward growth. Helping people restores self-

respect for Protagonists, but only when they support the autonomy of the people

they help.


Fortunately, Protagonists project their expectations on others only when they lose

sight of what’s important to them. Part of rebalancing their self-respect can mean

sorting out the difference between their needs and the needs of others, then

attending to those of others. Defining their essential intentions can help Protagonists

achieve clarity in this area.


Maintaining a clear vision starts by defining core values. Core values aren’t things to

create; people discover them by examining what they consider important in life. The

following exercise is a way that Protagonists can define their core values:


   •   Write a response for each of the following five prompts. Take a few minutes

       for each. Be as specific as possible.

          o I was most happy when …

          o I was most satisfied when …

          o I was most proud when …

          o I was most angry when …

          o If I could do anything to make the world better, I would …




                                “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     58
                                                                       Personal Growth


   •   Based on your answers, write a two-sentence value statement about what is

       important and serves as your motivation to act in a way that impacts the world.

       In the statement, describe how you can live your best life.


Keeping a clear view of their purpose and mission can help Protagonists maintain

their self-respect, giving them paths that sustain their ideals and goals. A written

value statement serves as a guide to help them stay in line with their basic intentions.



                              Self-Confidence

Self-confidence is the internal impetus that gives people the emotional energy

needed to move forward. When Protagonists feel self-confident, it’s because of an

innate certainty that assures them they’re on the right side of what’s genuine and

true according to their standards.


                          Balanced Self-Confidence

                                Intentionally Authentic


For people with this personality type, a balanced sense of self-confidence comes

from feeling connected to their true selves. They loathe anything they regard as

phony and always strive to be real. Masks, lies, and insincerity offend Protagonists

with an intensity that can surprise even their closest friends. A sense of sureness and

conviction found within themselves, as well as rejection of dishonesty, provide the

motivation they need to act confidently.


To feel confident, people with this personality type must remain true to who they are.

To feel confident in their relationships, they must feel others are just as honest. This

need for truthfulness goes beyond simply telling the truth all the time –Protagonists



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         59
                                                                        Personal Growth


must live their truths. A profound commitment to truth lies beneath their self-

reliance and their life pursuits. It affects their confidence if, for even a moment, they

believe they’re insincere or pretentious.


                                  Knowing Themselves


The root of the self-confidence of Protagonists is their self-understanding. Only when

they know their true selves can they behave faithfully toward themselves. These

outwardly-focused individuals prefer to share their visions and beliefs with others,

but self-confidence also requires introspection as its starting point. Protagonist are

most confident when they give adequate attention to both the things they think and

the things they do.


Protagonists may need to more deliberately follow the ancient Greek dictum to

“know thyself.” This takes some introspection about ethics and beliefs. Their default

setting for this task may be to look to their own behaviors. However, Protagonists

base their actions on deeply held principles, and they must also decide whether

they’re living up to those standards. By considering both their behaviors and their

principles, they frame what it means to be genuine. This allows Protagonists to live

in a way that reflects their true nature. The balance of internal understanding and

external meaning yields the confidence to energize their intentions into

accomplishments.


                         Unbalanced Self-Confidence

                             Finding an Ever-Changing Self


Being genuine is a wholesome source of confidence. But if the sense of self isn’t

treated as a living, changing entity, it can be unstable. Protagonists set their goals



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         60
                                                                          Personal Growth


around growth and are likely to experience personal changes throughout their lives.

“Self,” for them, isn’t fixed in time and space – it isn’t static. As a result, neither are

the things that give them self-confidence.


When unconfident Protagonists experience variations in their own sense of self and

purpose, they may hold on to the security of the old at the expense of the new. The

obvious flaw is that, with growth, some part of them has changed. If they rely solely

on what gave them confidence in the past, they can discover they no longer espouse

the exact same standards or beliefs. They may see themselves as unintentional

frauds, and their self-confidence may crumble. Only the words “I am no longer that

person” can bring them closer to the truth.


Refusal to accept change on a less introspective level also comes into play.

Protagonists can become overly invested in their causes, making it hard for them to

change course once they commit. Not all those they lead may understand or accept

inevitable changes, complicating matters even further. Because Protagonists’ self-

confidence comes from feeling connected to their genuine selves, feeling obliged to

an obsolete “self,” whether because of internal inflexibility or external resistance, can

leave them feeling uncertain and drained.


                              Unintentionally Manipulative


On the other side of the scale, Protagonists can also suffer from an overabundance

of confidence, which they may use to manipulate others. If Protagonists manipulate

others, they usually do so unwittingly: empathizing with another person,

understanding their concerns, coming up with a solution to their problem, and then

convincing them it’s the right course of action – without fully considering what the

other person needs or wants. In darker, desperate moments, they can even resort to



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           61
                                                                        Personal Growth


more conscious, Machiavellian persuasiveness if they feel it’s justified – and

extravagant self-confidence can seem to provide all the justification necessary.


Confidence becomes a problem for Protagonists when they project their visions over

the facts, and because they’re usually adept at communicating their ideas, their

enthusiasm can be contagious. It’s important that they recognize and understand

their persuasive powers, then strive to use them wisely. Even the best intentions can

produce unforeseen negative results when Protagonists fail to balance their self-

confidence against others’ best interests.


                        Rebalancing Self-Confidence

                                   Embracing Change


Protagonists are reasonably comfortable with change, in the sense that growth is

change. But they prefer change when it’s manageable and predictable – something

that is the product of their goals and remains in their control. If it comes too quickly,

too randomly, or if they face resistance, change can make Protagonists lose

confidence. This is especially true if their definition of themselves become muddled

in the process, if they feel like they’ve lost some sense of themselves. One of the ways

to manage this is to encourage flexibility and security in the face of changes, small or

large.


For Protagonists, monitoring their reactions to change can be a lifelong task, and it

requires vigilance. Paying attention to their reactions is likely the most basic skill

when it comes to appreciating and embracing evolution. Change is famously one of

the few constants in the universe, and its abundance provides ample opportunity for

observation. Because change can be unpredictable in everyday life, however, here

are a variety of ways Protagonists can experiment:


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         62
                                                                         Personal Growth


   •   Find a piece of rejected clothing in the back of your closet. Perhaps it was a

       gift from an older relative or an unfashionable friend. Wear it just for one

       day.

   •   Pick something that is an elective daily habit, then change it for a week. For

       example, if you eat lunch at the same three restaurants repeatedly, avoid

       eating at any of them for a week. Find entirely new restaurants.

   •   For a week, drive home from work using new and different routes.

   •   If you have the flexibility, turn the day’s schedule on its head. Take the task

       you usually do last and put it first, and flip the rest of the schedule in the

       same manner.

   •   Notice any reaction to these artificial adjustments. Although they may not feel

       as permanent or as profound as other changes, they likely will reveal the way

       you feel about and react to change. And they may help you train yourself to

       handle change.


Finding a degree of comfort in the face of change can help Protagonists maintain a

sense of control – central to a balanced sense of self-confidence.


                                   About Manipulation


Everybody uses indirect methods to influence others from time to time, and the

human condition involves playing both roles. Judging the malignancy of manipulation

involves judging the motivating factors, the degree, and the frequency. Protagonists

who manipulate are likely to do it unconsciously and for reasons they feel are benign.

However, when the frequency and intensity get out of hand, they can rebalance it

only if they admit they have a capacity for exploitation. The first step is accepting that

all humans indirectly sway others all the time, even values-minded Protagonists.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                            63
                                                                          Personal Growth


Once they accept that some methods they use are manipulative, they can begin to

examine them and decide how to be less calculating. When people manipulate, they

nudge others using indirect tactics. To counter that impulse, Protagonists can ask for

what they want directly and succinctly as a habit, so others are clear about their

requests and informed enough to decide whether they want to acquiesce or not. This

doesn’t mean that Protagonists’ persuasive charms can never be useful tools, but

they may prefer to avoid mind games once they’re aware of their capacity to harm.


The following exercises can help Protagonists develop consciousness in this area:


   •   Develop a list of a minimum of five things to ask other people to do. If

       necessary, remember past situations when such requests were not made

       and use those. However, the more current and relevant the requests, the

       more useful they’re likely to be.

   •   Ask a trusted friend, family member, counselor, or colleague to play the role

       of scorekeeper.

   •   Going down the list, write each request in two steps.

          o Step one: Write the request in a simple, actionable sentence of fewer

                than 10 words. (Count them.)

          o Step two: Write an explanation of why it needs to be done in no more

                than two medium-length sentences.

   •   Ask your activity partner to read and score the requests using the following

       scale.

           o If both the request and the reason were not clear and direct, and/or

                both were too long, give it a score of one point. (Use this score if

                neither part of the request met the instructions perfectly.)




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         64
                                                                          Personal Growth


           o If either the request or the reason was not clear or direct, or it was

              too long, give it a score of two points. (Use this score only if one-half

              of the process did not comply with the instructions.)

           o Give the request three points if both parts of the request complied

              with the instructions.

   •   Together, go over the reasons for the scores, and then repeat the exercise

       until all the requests on the list earn a score of three points.



                                 Self-Evolution

The term “self-evolution” describes a more purposeful effort of establishing one’s

identity and direction. It involves tactics and strategies needed to fulfill self-esteem,

self-confidence, and self-respect needs. Protagonists, like most Diplomats, not only

enjoy the process of self-evolution, but also find meaning in the process itself; they

see it as being as important as the results.


                            Balanced Self-Evolution

                               Constant Self-Improvement


Self-evolution goes beyond just self-improvement. It also involves Protagonists

developing a deep personal understanding of themselves, as seen through their

values, goals, and purposes. This reflection helps them define themselves.


However, understanding without any clear tactics for further growth amounts to

navel-gazing, and people with this personality type are unlikely to find much

satisfaction that way. Much of their value comes from how they interact with the

world and contribute to it, and a plan ensures they do so with satisfaction.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         65
                                                                         Personal Growth


Protagonists exercising this effort strive to increase their ability to help others grow

and to help society, or at least their corner of it, become a better place.


                           Self-Development as a Sacred Duty


Protagonists are likely to see growth and development as not only thing to aspire

toward, but sacred duties. Whether they stand on secular, religious, or spiritual

foundations, they typically have a missionary zeal for the matters that excite them –

and those matters usually involve leading people to a better place.


For Protagonists, it’s an abdication of duty to undertake their missions without the

right equipment. Their most important equipment includes an understanding of

what other people need as well as the ability to lead and persuade. Self-improvement

and greater insight are serious and constant business for this personality type.


                          Unbalanced Self-Evolution

                                    Extreme Growth


Some Protagonists find it difficult to balance all the parts of their lives because they

can become almost obsessively involved with their work and side projects. Self-care,

self-image, relationships, and recreation can all lose priority while they try to save the

world. Protagonists may become so focused on making others’ lives better that they

forget to take some time to really live their own. Although much of their growth

happens through their interactions with others, they still need to experience the

growth that comes from experiencing life.


Some Protagonists swing too far the other way, becoming so involved in self-

improvement that they neglect other areas of their lives, such as social connections

or basic work responsibilities. Spiritual, emotional, and ethical development in the


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          66
                                                                      Personal Growth


pursuit of their true selves or purpose can remove them from what most would call

the “real world.” Even though they’re unlikely to cloister themselves in some self-

made hermitage, Protagonists may be so focused on their potential that they fail to

engage fully in the here and now.


                            Satisfaction Just Out of Reach


One of the greatest barriers that Protagonists face in their self-evolution process is

unevenness in how they develop. Because of their strong desire to grow into their

“true selves,” they may get caught up in the process of evolution, losing sight of who

they already are.


As wonderful (and necessary) as self-evolution is, obsessing over growth can do as

much harm as good. Tunnel vision can lead to constant dissatisfaction, and the

resulting discontentment can cause Protagonists to burn out. Even the most selfless,

humble, or confident individuals need the occasional reward of knowing they’re

gaining traction. The frustration of always striving yet never experiencing the

pleasure of growth can be demoralizing and demotivating. Protagonists who never

enjoy rich, satisfying moments along the way may struggle to find joy or happiness

in their development.


                         Rebalancing Self-Evolution

                           Embracing Growth Responsibly


Determined Protagonists can be restless and demanding when it comes to personal

growth. They like to explore everything, including the secrets of human nature,

principles, and causes, even the depths of their own minds.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       67
                                                                       Personal Growth


This focus on growth is one of the essential qualities that distinguish Protagonists

from many other personality types. Mature Protagonists understand that self-

evolution is a progression, not an end itself. They take thoughtful, deliberate steps in

development, and they balance their evolutionary path with a holistic approach.

However, their focus isn’t only on “becoming” – they occasionally allow themselves

simply to “be” as well. They weigh spontaneity and serendipitous insights against

broader, organized ideas that ensure a connection to the more mundane but

necessary parts of life. Dreams and visions don’t rule their growth, but rather

combine with more practical considerations.


Improvisation in the arts is a metaphor for this mindset. When someone plays

improvisational jazz, they’re aware of how music works, and they know how to make

it work. A jazz saxophone player composes music on the spot, but only because she

knows the rules and has a vision for what the song is and where it’s going. There are

plotlines, themes, and moods to the music. It would be unbearable to listen to

someone who didn’t know music if they stood up and tried to do the same thing.

Protagonists who balance their self-evolution learn to play their lives like smooth,

improvisational jazz – with some skills, some dreams, some principles, some clear

direction, some freedom, and some self-care, all combined.


Here are some things Protagonists can try to rebalance their self-development,

through a study of improvisation:


   •   In the next week, spend some time experiencing some improvisation. Type

       “improv” or “improvisation” into streaming video services for a host of options.

   •   Watch some examples of improvisation in music, drama, visual art, and

       beyond.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         68
                                                                         Personal Growth


   •   Once you’ve observed, seek out instructional material on improv. It doesn’t

       matter which medium. Just spend some time appreciating the many facets of

       improvisation.

   •   Write down what you’ve observed about improvisational art. How can you use

       your findings to approach self-evolution?


Living life spontaneously yet staying rooted in principles and strategy creates a

sublime balance in the purposeful lives of Protagonists. Those who find this balance

are likely to be effective and find their paths to their best selves.


                                    Enjoying Plateaus


In mountain climbing, a plateau is a place to stop, rest, and enjoy the view – to

appreciate the terrain just traveled. Protagonists who find themselves driven by

growth can look for plateaus in their journey through life. If satisfaction feels elusive,

it may be that, in their intense wish to grow, they haven’t taken time to notice that

reasons for satisfaction and happiness abound. A lack of joy or even contentment

can suggest the need for Protagonists to stop and evaluate their lives and

accomplishments as the joyous moments they are.


Like most people, Protagonists need to feel some sense of success along the way.

There is a reason humans celebrate, beyond a built-in desire to party – celebrations

are a chance to stop and appreciate progress. Celebrations reinforce positive

moments. Fêtes revel in past accomplishments and launch the participants into new

ones. Protagonists who aren’t experiencing satisfaction may simply need to find

opportunities to celebrate.


Some ways this type can try to rebalance their sense of self-evolution:




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          69
                                                                      Personal Growth


   •   Gather family and friends to toast all accomplishment of the past 30 days.

       Make room to celebrate everyone, yourself included. (If no accomplishments

       come to mind, ask those attending for help coming up with ideas.)

   •   Write down three new goals to pursue. Plan an event to recognize their

       completion. It doesn’t have to be extravagant. Just stop and recognize success.

   •   Look for ways to help others celebrate. Find one reason to congratulate one

       other person this month. Bring a box of donuts to work for the occasion, or

       bring home flowers or wine. Bring family and friends into the circle to raise a

       glass to growth. Just make sure the gesture is attached to the accomplishment.


Taking time to acknowledge accomplishments and celebrate progress is great way to

reinforce self-evolution and to motivate greater attention to strategies for

development. Milestones are important motivators. By not appreciating them,

Protagonists deny themselves a fair assessment of their true progress.




                              Self-Responsibility

Self-responsibility is Protagonists’ ability to take charge of their decisions and the

consequences without being dependent on others or believing all that happens is

fate. By honestly attributing their actions, they can take both credit and blame with

integrity, as well as accept what is and isn’t in their control.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     70
                                                                       Personal Growth


                        Balanced Self-Responsibility

                                 Independent Choices


Although they are collaborative by nature, Protagonists who practice balanced self-

responsibility think independently. They decide their priorities and follow their

interests, maintaining reasonable independence while also sustaining a healthy

respect for others’ wisdom and experience. This sense of independence allows them

to enforce their personal boundaries without guilt – and lets them afford others the

same right. They engage in self-care to avoid burnout and vulnerability, knowing that

good stewardship of their own health and welfare is part of being responsible.


This plays out in their personal lives as well as in the leadership and mentoring roles

they often occupy. Having a sense of personal responsibility, making decisions with

authority, and being accountable are the marks of people who lead with integrity.

U.S. President Truman had a sign on his desk reminding him: “The buck stops here.”

Protagonists, when they keep these characteristics balanced, can be comfortable

prominently placing that sign in full view of others. However, this doesn’t mean they

encourage others to surrender their own responsibility, nor do they force others to

depend on them. Helping others grow means helping them come to grips with their

own duties; when Protagonists are on the right course, they’re strong examples of

what that means.


                                 Proactive Approach


People with the Protagonist personality type who practice balanced self-

responsibility are proactive. They know their core values and use them to achieve

their personal goals. Self-responsibility goes beyond self-understanding, however. It




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        71

includes carrying out plans, taking responsibility for their results – both good and bad

– and recognizing that the results impact others.


Most people don’t have perfect lives or meet their goals flawlessly. Growth often

emerges from trial and error, and failures often contribute to learning and

development. Protagonists who act of their own accord understand their

responsibilities when they do so, accept the results, and learn from their experiences,

and their development vigorously benefits. The essential component is accepting

responsibility for the result. Only then do they realize growth.


                       Unbalanced Self-Responsibility

                                      Perfectionists


Protagonists are passionate and show great determination when they care about

something. Being responsible individuals, they may stall rather than do anything that

can fail, because they would be accountable for the failure and accountable to the

people affected by their decisions. Many suffer from logistical difficulties when trying

to follow their passions and goals. Usually skillful at organization and highly

proactive, some individuals with this personality type struggle with getting started.

Protagonists’ perfectionism can get in the way of progress when there are so many

ways to achieve their goals or chase their passions. In their effort to take the perfect

path forward, people with this personality type can become indecisive for weeks,

months, years, or even a lifetime.


Procrastination stemming from perfectionism can be especially difficult for these

outgoing people. As if their indecision isn’t intimidating enough, they’re also likely to

grapple with it in the company of other people, making it a more public matter. In

addition, they tend to take leadership positions, so their decisions affect not only


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         72
                                                                         Personal Growth


themselves, but also those they lead. If they suffer from any insecurity, they may

futilely search for a perfect solution. Unfortunately, life doesn’t often hand those out

– there are rarely perfect solutions, only better ones.


                                  Practical Responsibility


Ethics and moral courage are driving forces in the lives of Protagonists, and they tend

to handle these areas of responsibility well. But big ideas alone don’t meet goals. If

people with this personality type fail to attend to details, their high-minded intentions

will remain mere notions, or worse; inspiring people to undertake an arduous

journey without a source of bread and water is irresponsible.


Protagonists dislike dealing with the mundane aspects that go along with achieving

long-term goals. If they don’t make sure that their minds stay on track, particularly

during relatively dull phases, they can experience a two-fold problem. First, mundane

but necessary tasks may go undone, leaving loose ends that must be tied up later (or

can derail the goal completely). Secondly, Protagonists’ strong sense of duty to others

means they’re likely to suffer guilt for neglecting important details. Self-responsibility

requires taking responsibility for every aspect of life, and focus ensures they don’t

overlook day-to-day details.


Goal-oriented and idealistic, people with this personality type often direct all their

attention to the goal, missing small yet important details in the process. It’s hard to

argue that someone is acting responsibly when that happens. Sometimes a great and

noble project can fail because someone forgot to check the legal details, handle

administrative tasks, estimate the workload, or even account for the fact that key

participants didn’t share the vision.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         73
                                                                         Personal Growth


                       Rebalancing Self-Responsibility

                                Embracing Imperfection


One of this personality type’s biggest challenges is learning how to consider all

aspects of a situation without letting infatuation with idealism cloud their judgment.

Their tactical preference for Judging pushes Protagonists to commit sooner rather

than later, but learning how to exercise control over their ideas can help keep these

types from stretching themselves too thin.


Nobody makes the right decision all the time or acts in a consistently perfect manner.

Protagonists, with all their insight, aren’t infallible. If they’re to embrace their

responsibilities, they also need to embrace their imperfections. Waiting for a

guaranteed perfect outcome is likely to lead to paralysis more than action – and

taking responsibility often means acting. Fortunately, these types are unlikely to act

rashly when making decisions that affect others or themselves.


For those who bring themselves to accept the imperfections of their own lives,

procrastination isn’t likely to be a major stumbling block. Once they come to terms

with the fact that no decision or action can be perfect, then give themselves

permission to be responsibly flawed, they can lower their expectations to a

reasonable level. Doing their best and accepting their part in the outcome cover any

duty they have in most situations.


The following exercise can help Protagonists take the first small step toward this

acceptance:


   •   Choose an activity that is challenging but not overwhelming. It might be

       participating in a sport, trying an artistic activity, or doing a small home repair



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          74
                                                                        Personal Growth


       – anything moderately considered a challenge. (Make sure to pay attention to

       all safety issues, and keep in mind that a good challenge is one that is difficult

       but not impossible.)

   •   Engage in the activity knowing that “good enough” is sometimes good enough.

   •   When finished, assess the activity. Was it perfect? Even if it wasn’t, was it a

       worthy effort? Celebrate the flaws with a good laugh.

   •   Afterward, contemplate: What does this exercise reveal about being perfect?


On the surface, being perfect may sound like the most responsible path. However, in

practical terms, it can lead to paralysis and indecision, so it may be the least

responsible thing Protagonists can do.


                                    Improving Focus


It doesn’t matter how high-minded the ideals – if the nuts and bolts aren’t tight

enough, the whole machine may fall apart, and that’s hardly a responsible approach.

Learning to keep focus and muddle through the details, especially with long-term

goals and projects, reflects a responsible attitude.


For Protagonists, the trick for remaining focused, oddly, is to set aside plenty of time

every day for their mind to wander. Setting breaks for a walk or meditation, for

example, makes longer periods of focus easier to achieve. Bringing themselves into

the here and now can improve their attention to detail and help them regulate their

obsessive attention to their higher passions. Knowing when to take a break and when

to focus is integral to responsible Protagonist behavior.


Embracing this personality type’s natural tendency to strategize and make plans can

be useful. But relaxing their attention on “big-picture” considerations for a while can

allow the smaller details to emerge from the background and take a more prominent


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         75
                                                                         Personal Growth


position in the forefront. The following exercise can help Protagonists move between

the big picture and the details while giving adequate attention to both:


   •    Find the most beautiful object available in the vicinity.

   •    Take a plain piece of paper and a pencil – a regular pencil is fine, but a colored

        pencil may make the exercise more interesting.

   •    With an eye toward getting as close to photo accuracy as possible, draw the

        object. This isn’t about talent. Nonetheless, doing the best work possible in this

        exercise means being as accurate as possible.

   •    Should the mind drift toward more symbolic or abstract considerations, return

        to thoughts of lines, shadows, and colors. Be a camera more than an artist. Let

        the smaller details emerge.

   •    Post the picture somewhere public or private as reminder to view the small-

        scale details rather than only focusing on objects in a large-scale manner.


It’s fine to have lofty goals designed to address noble issues. But unless Protagonists

consider the details, it may all come to nothing. Like the old saying, sometimes they

“can’t see the trees for the forest.” Responsibility demands that people with this

personality type balance attention to the individual trees as well as the forest they

form.


                                   Conclusion
                              Growing So Others Might Grow


The world needs Protagonists to grow so that they can use their insights and

nurturing leadership to encourage growth in others. Their combination of traits

allows them to fill a variety of mentoring niches, and society would be poorer without

their contributions. But their own personal growth is essential to their effectiveness.

Fortunately, it’s also something they highly desire for themselves.


Protagonists who exploit their strengths while expanding their comfort zones find

growth by balancing integrity within themselves with adaptation toward the world

around them. Understanding who they are and acting in ways that honor their values

create fulfillment and a life of purpose for people with this personality type.


All Protagonists have their own spin on life, having adapted to their unique

circumstances in many ways. Some skillfully navigate the process of personal growth

most of the time; others, some of the time; and still others may struggle. Like all

people, they fluctuate between days filled with wonderful growth and other days that

lack, or even seem to undo, that growth. No one goes through life in a perfect way.

Nonetheless, growth and learning are always choices for those who are willing.

Hopefully, this section has provided Protagonists with some guidance and inspiration

to bolster that willingness.

                                                                           Friendships



                                Friendships




                                   Deep and Strong


People with the Protagonist personality type bring inspired energy to their

friendships, as with all the other pursuits in their lives. Their enthusiasm is

contagious, and these outgoing people draw their friends into exciting fun when

given half a chance. When Protagonists find other people who enjoy the same kind

of activities, they form warm and caring friendships. Their sincerity can create

extraordinary kinship so honest and profound that it feels as strong as a family tie.


In addition to their closest friends, this type is also happy to engage a broad swathe

of people. Outgoing and bold, Protagonists form casual friendships very quickly and

easily. However, compromise isn’t something these idealists do easily, so they weed

out those who don’t share the depth of their idealism, or at least relegate them to

the status of “acquaintance.”


Protagonists possess an aura of thoughtful support that naturally confers influence

and draws other people to them. They may even become the center of their chosen

social groups, reveling in the trust and admiration that their friends have for them.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        78
                                                                            Friendships


In return, Protagonists offer their friends unending support and care from the heart.

It’s more than just noble sincerity; Protagonists are energetic and, quite simply, a lot

of fun. Those lucky enough to become good friends with them find great joy and

adventures in their company.


                               Exceptional Expectations


Although gregarious, people with this personality type can also be exacting, obsessed

with their ideas, the future, and musings about what the world – and they themselves

– might become. Taken to an excessive degree, this drive can take the form of

stringent expectations that create an imposing social barrier to some people. If

someone strays too far from Protagonists’ ideal, they may try to pull the person back

– and that effort is not always welcome. What Protagonists demand is exhausting for

many other types, and it may clash with their friends’ vision for themselves.


When Protagonists expect unrealistically perfect friendships, they run the risk of

being disappointed. But when they try to force others to conform, they also risk

pushing their friends away – no one likes to be judged. They may even forgo new

friendships that, were it not for their extreme expectations, would have grown into

mutually satisfying relationships. However, their generous hearts and unending

desire to grow offer Protagonists a chance to see when their actions are interfering

with positive connections.


                             Further Extending Compassion


Compassion is often the key to compromise, and Protagonists have an energetic,

idealistic approach toward differences in others. People with this personality type

think nothing of bending over backward to help their friends, and if they realize their

own mistakes, they won’t stop until they are fixed. Their own capacity for confident


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         79
                                                                            Friendships


generosity is one of the greatest tools Protagonists possess for forming a realistic

picture of friendship, as it can bridge any difference.


Other personality types can be challenging for Protagonists, but extending

compassion and accepting others enable connections with even with the most

seemingly incompatible types. Maturity, wisdom, and mutual respect can create

rewarding friendships with any combination of personalities. Protagonists, with their

ability to connect emotionally and their desire for such knowledge, are well-suited to

find common ground with others through conscious acts of appreciation.

Let’s examine the challenges Protagonists face and the joys they experience in

friendships with those belonging to each of the Roles: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels,

and Explorers. Any pairing can be an exciting adventure for this friendly, loving type.

Knowing there may be occasional glitches in potential friendships shouldn’t

discourage them; awareness can help them find their way along the sometimes-

difficult path to meaningful friendship.

                 Protagonist–Analyst Friendships




Protagonists and Analysts share a marvelous ability to not only imagine many

possibilities, but also delve deeply into a subject, seeing its many facets. The angle

from which they glimpse these facets can be heavily informed by their underlying

differences, making for an exciting and intellectually stimulating friendship. When

these friends keep an open mind, they’ll find each other to be among their most

respected friends, both impressed with the sincerity and depth of each other’s

thoughts.


               Balanced Protagonist–Analyst Friendships

                            Complementary Imaginations


To Protagonists, having Analyst friends can feel like an extension of their own minds,

but with an expanded perspective. Analysts enjoy using their rationality to play the

role of creative consultant to friends – they pride themselves on their logic and

impartiality. Analysts are bluntly honest, especially with their closest friends, and

Protagonists may see this as a blessing and a curse. They can be irritated when




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       81

Analyst friends criticize one of their pet causes or values, but they also know that

checking ideas against honest critiques has value.


Possibly because they don’t always agree, Protagonist and Analyst friends make quite

the team when they create fun ideas together, and they love to do so. Both types

have expansive imaginations, but neither necessarily uses their imagination to

realistic ends: Analysts enjoy inventing complex systems and can feel satisfied with

mere thought experiments. Protagonists imagine grand outcomes with little concern

for how they’ll achieve them, and they’re always ready to jump into action.


Fortunately for these friends, their distinct traits often balance each other out.

Protagonist and Analyst friends offer each other more diverse worldviews than either

has alone. When they’re willing to take the best of each worldview and combine them

cooperatively, the combined force of their imaginations can create amazing fun

together.


                            Balancing Each Other’s Views


These friends can also help each other on a deeply personal level. With their

emotions always at the fore, Protagonists excel at seeing complex human struggles

in relatable ways. Analysts take a more calculated view of things, so they can help

Protagonists balance passionate idealism with a bit of hard logic – and vice versa.

There’s quite a difference between hope and reality, but each perspective can

influence the other productively as these friends help each other understand.

Protagonists appreciate the difference between beating their heads against a wall

and fighting the good fight, and Analysts’ impartial rationality helps them keep their

energy focused where it can be effective.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       82

Analysts sometimes lose sight of the grand possibilities in life – and they’re lucky

when they have Protagonists to stand as examples of how faith and passion can

overcome odds that appear insurmountable. The infectious enthusiasm of

Protagonists helps Analysts expand their own view of what’s possible, opening

opportunities for fun as well as valuable personal growth. Protagonists don’t let

Analyst friends hide behind facts or logic, frequently pressing them to incorporate

less tangible values into their picture of reality. Each of these types has a powerful

mind for learning from each other, and both are better for it.


              Unbalanced Protagonist–Analyst Friendships

                                     Soured Idealism


Tension can arise from the different filters these friends use to make decisions:

humanism for Protagonists versus rationalism for Analysts. Protagonists implement

solutions to address human needs, but they frequently underestimate very real

limits and logistical challenges, which dismays Analysts. Analysts often see society as

an almost mechanical system, focusing less on the welfare of the individual pieces

than the efficient functionality of the whole – a mindset Protagonists find too cold.

To Protagonists, those “pieces” are valuable human beings.


Protagonists don’t appreciate challenges to their sacred values, but Analysts poke

and prod instinctively in the name of exploring ideas – a recipe for arguments. When

clinical rationality goes up against heartfelt passion, it can feel like a battle of morals,

especially when opinions and ideas about society are the subject. Neither of these

types can put their best foot forward when they dig in their heels. Instead of

considering their equally valid perspectives and moving forward together with

improved ideas, sometimes these types retreat into resentment.



                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           83

                            Troubling Emotional Differences


Friendships between people of these types can also experience an empathy gap,

despite their best intentions and an appreciation of each other. Protagonists are well-

tuned to emotional understanding, always working to resolve upset feelings, but

Analysts are rarely comfortable with showing emotions to begin with. They struggle

to understand and express feelings, which often makes them seem slow, awkward,

and reserved in emotional situations. When a response such as sympathy is expected

by Protagonists, Analysts often flounder, leaving both friends wondering what’s

wrong with each other.


Protagonists may even start to resent it when Analysts try to use rationality to “fix” a

situation while ignoring emotion, even viewing them as unfeeling. They may begin to

pull back from their connection as friends or, worse, push more emotion on Analysts,

causing them to retreat in bewilderment. If this usually innocent disconnection is not

balanced with mutual understanding, it can kill any chance of deep honesty and

mutual reliance in this friendship. Both friends want to care for each other, but given

their differences, they might not understand how best to do so.


              Rebalancing Protagonist–Analyst Friendships

                                Keeping an Open Mind


When clashes occur between their styles, these friends must make a concerted effort

to recapture the way they inspire and respect each other. Protagonists and Analysts

have a big advantage here: Their expansive imaginations help them understand

alternative perspectives. Sharing their views comes naturally to these types; in fact,

such conversations initially brought them closer, and discussions about their diverse

perspectives can remain a source of fun and inspiration when refreshed with


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         84
                                                                            Friendships


genuine respect. But conversation shouldn’t necessarily be the end; these friends can

show each other how their different points of view work in daily life.


Protagonist and Analyst friends can also “agree to disagree” on some things,

accepting that certain subjects may never be fun to talk about together. This doesn’t

mean they must always avoid friendly arguments, but when they repeatedly hit an

immovable point of contention, wisdom demands that they just let it go. They can

accept that differing approaches to life may work better for each of them as

individuals.


Both types should understand that being right is not as important as respecting each

other, so they can drop stubborn ego in favor of friendship itself. The good times

they can share are a lot more fulfilling than winning an argument. In their efforts to

be truly open to each other, these friends can practice the following tips during

disagreements:


   •   When your friend expresses a point of view, stop and listen objectively before

       responding.

   •   As your friend speaks, consider whether they are presenting theory or their

       actual lifestyle choices. If the latter, consider that your disagreement could be

       tantamount to a personal indictment – and proceed gently.

   •   If something seems disagreeable, ask for more information – perhaps an

       example of how they make it work in their own lives.

   •   Before dismissing each other’s views and lifestyles, try them out; ask for

       guidance on how.

   •   If, after giving something a fair shot and due consideration, you disagree with

       something, say so respectfully, stressing that it’s just a personal choice, not a

       judgment.


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        85
                                                                           Friendships


   •   After a disagreement, reaffirm the friendship by diving immediately into an

       area of commonality, such as a favorite restaurant, game, or pastime.


Tolerance may not be easy for either Protagonists or Analysts, but willingness to at

least briefly try on each other’s views is the highest form of respect.


                               Equally Valuable Abilities


If Protagonists want emotional support from Analysts, they can just say so. If they’re

careful not to criticize Analysts as flawed, there’s nothing wrong with asking for help

and trading advice. Analysts deeply value their true friends, and they enjoy

expanding their abilities, so Protagonists can help them understand the truth of how

friends make each other feel through their behavior.


Protagonists tend to be up front and vocal about their needs, but they also need to

be literal; that’s how Analysts are, and it speaks to them. Whether asking Analysts to

be less harsh in their presentation, more open with their feelings, or sympathetic in

times of need, Protagonists are usually impressed at how quickly these types learn

when motivated by friendship. Analysts are very capable of emotional evolution,

especially with Protagonists serving as excellent examples.


But responsibility for keeping balance can’t fall solely on Analysts; Protagonists can

learn a lot from their friends about the value of a detached approach in certain

situations. Sometimes delving fully into emotional responses is the equivalent of

pouring gas on a fire; a reserved attitude can be just as beneficial in some moments

as emotionally openness is in others, and these friends can learn from each other’s

example.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        86

And of course, when either friend tries to understand the other, positive feedback is

always appropriate: for example, “I really appreciate the way you try to see my

perspective.”


The following tips can help Protagonists resolve their emotional differences with

Analysts:


   •   Ask for a moment to talk. Pick a place comfortable for both.

   •   Express the issue, whether personal or in the friendship.

   •   Practice emotional control; speak calmly and deliberately, and don’t interrupt.

   •   Use “me” and “I” statements, focusing on what you need rather than on any

       deficits you may perceive in your friend.

   •   Be specific about the support you need (e.g., creative ideas, sympathetic

       listening, reassurance).

   •   When your friend provides the support you were looking for, offer positive

       feedback and show appreciation.


Analysts have every right to make inverted requests: They may need a break from

emotional connectedness. Protagonists should remain willing to dial down their own

seriousness and share in some humorous, lighthearted fun.

               Protagonist–Diplomat Friendships




Close Diplomat friends often closely mirror each other, as Diplomats can be just as

enthusiastic, passionate, kind, and imaginative toward each other as to other people

and other types. Protagonists love to meet up for active fun together, and

conversations between these friends can be delightfully addictive. Because

Diplomats are rare among the constellation of personality types, these friends try

hard to maintain such precious friendships regardless of any difficulties they may

face.

                                  Friends at Heart


Protagonists who form true friendships with other Diplomats experience the wonder

of gaining an intellectual and emotional extension of themselves. Both friends share

experiences with and through each other, gaining the benefit and wisdom of each

other’s triumphs and trials. “I have the most amazing idea …” is often heard between

these friends. Diplomats can motivate and support each other through life with the

energy of their kindness. And in some ways, their deep communication offers them

a chance to live two lives at once as they share great fun together.


Protagonist and Diplomat friends are also well-suited to care for each other in times

of trouble, leaning on each other and expressing feelings freely. A deep personal

knowledge of their friends’ uniqueness combined with their caring nature makes

them wonderful emotional resources for each other. Each knows what the other

needs and when they need it. Sometimes they offer comfort and sympathy,

sometimes encouragement (Protagonists may even offer a loving kick to the rear),

but good Diplomat friends are always wellsprings of support.


                               Creativity and Excitement


The connection between these friends goes beyond emotion, encompassing realms

of exciting and creative imagination as well. When Protagonists and other Diplomats

share a mutual interest, they inspire each other further into it. Much of this energy

comes from sharing core qualities that drive both friends in similar directions. That

doesn't necessarily mean the same direction – they are, after all, unique individuals.

But by weaving together harmonious but not identical paths, these friends can

glimpse things from different points of view, a real gift for both.


Ideas are just the beginning of this pair’s adventures. When it comes to creative

pursuits, Protagonists may lead the charge, but they find that other Diplomats make

helpful partners. When these types create a trusting friendship, balance arises not

just from exchanging insights and dreams, but also from sharing happy experiences.

Even Introverted Diplomats find themselves drawn into adventure and excitement

by Protagonists, who offer a caring energy that can motivate others to jump into life.

            Unbalanced Protagonist–Diplomat Friendships

                                Insulating Each Other


One challenge for Protagonists and their Diplomat friends comes from the same

source that fuels their friendship – their similarity. When these friends give each

other too much reassurance and inspiration based on their shared perspective, it can

create a bubble that isolates them from different opinions and worldviews.

Protagonists’ Judging trait can sometimes prevent them from being open-minded,

and they may find comfort in common approaches and opinions. When these friends’

agreement shields them from the world’s stark differences, they may also shut out

the benefits of fresh perspectives.


Another downside to this pair’s harmonious connection is mismatch of resolve.

Protagonists love active change, but their firm vision of what must be done might

miss the mark. They may simply push their views too strongly for other types to

absorb, especially if those friends see a different path for themselves. The inverse is

also possible; Diplomat friends can be reluctant – or not willful enough – to push

Protagonists beyond their habits and views, preferring to help them feel happy

rather than challenge their stability. Either scenario falls short of encouraging

beneficial change.


                                  Emotional Transfer


Similarity may also lead Protagonists and their Diplomat friends to unconsciously

manipulate each other. They might not try to pull the wool over each other’s eyes,

but their emotional bond and personal ideals can lead to internal bias. They may

confuse their own opinions for their friends’ best interests, and both types project

their feelings readily. Protagonists can be especially pushy, even if they don’t mean


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        90

to be. When this happens, criticism or advice may become more about what they

want than about what is right for those receiving it. The high level of emotional

connection between these friends can make it hard to tell the difference.


Furthermore, Protagonists and Diplomats are naturally sensitive to the emotional

states of their friends, so they can be more receptive than most to that kind of

influence. If a friend is upset, it’s contagious. The way they share emotions is one of

the most beautiful, healthy parts of Protagonist–Diplomat friendships, but emotional

independence is also a needed skill worth developing. Maintaining personal balance

during times of misery, anger, or stress is beneficial for both friends.


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Diplomat Friendships

                           Broadening Their Views Together


Protagonists and their Diplomat friends can break out of any ideological echo

chamber by using their gift of asking, “What if …?” out in the wider world. This may

mean joining larger groups with more diverse ideas, from book clubs to classes at a

community college, or they can find some other way to exit the bubbles they may

inadvertently create together. Protagonists’ social natures quickly pave the way for

both friends, and in their pursuit of rebalancing a special friendship with each other,

these friends will find that including others can be invaluable and exciting.


All Diplomats crave authenticity, so if Protagonists catch a glimpse of worthy qualities

outside their immediate realm of familiarity and acceptance, they will explore and

ultimately embrace those people. However, they need that glimpse first. Someone

with whom they didn’t initially feel commonality may have something of value to offer

through friendship after all, so they should keep open minds, seeking balance

together by widening their scope. They can use these steps to help:


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         91
                                                                             Friendships


   •   Agree together to broaden your views and seek the unknown.

   •   Keep an eye out for different, interesting people.

   •   Make their acquaintance and engage them socially.

   •   Discuss together anything learned from others’ unfamiliar perspectives.

   •   Maintain the strength of your own friendship, but try to include others as well.


When both friends work together to engage unusual people who might challenge

them, they can reassure each other – not to affirm their limits, but to support each

other in expanding them. Who knows what fun will come with different types of

friends?


                            Exercising Independent Thought


Protagonists and Diplomat friends can rebalance subtle manipulations by sharing

their feelings and opinions consciously. These friends carry a certain gravity with

each other because of the trust inherent in their relationship, but there is a difference

between pressure and communication. That may be something Protagonists, who

tend to be forceful, want to fine-tune, especially among Diplomat friends, where

emotions abound and harmony is prized. Realizing that influence can take

unconscious forms will allow them some awareness when it’s happening.


Fortunately, pressure is a betrayal of trust that these sensitive friends find repugnant,

and that is the key to rebalancing. Because these friends care so genuinely for each

other’s well-being, a mere mention of the appearance of any unfair pressure will hit

home and likely halt it. When one of these friends takes the time to gently express

their concerns, the other can look at their own behavior anew and do whatever it

takes to restore balance. It’s helpful for these friends to keep these ideas in mind:




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                           92
                                                                            Friendships


   •   Express criticism as constructive concern, openly and without emotional

       pressure.

   •   Don’t be afraid to respectfully consider but reject each other’s advice while

       staying firmly on a personal path.

   •   Try not to get too caught up in each other’s emotions. A little distance can

       enable better objectivity and, ultimately, better care for each other.


It’s important for these friends to be supportive, not controlling. Honestly making

their opinions known and offering each other help are enough – they don’t need to

feel responsible for each other’s decisions, nor take each other’s independence as

rejection.



                   Protagonist–Sentinel Friendships




Sentinels are the most reliable and consistent of the types, and Protagonists deeply

appreciate those qualities in their friends. Protagonists find their own sincerity

mirrored by the scrupulous steadiness of Sentinels, and that provides a foundation

for satisfying, long-term friendships. When these two find common ground, fun

abounds. This pair may also discover heartfelt inspiration together, as Protagonists’


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        93
                                                                           Friendships


dynamic energy is just as capable of moving mountains as Sentinels’ consistency and

dedication.


               Balanced Protagonist–Sentinel Friendships

                                Engaging Life Together


Protagonists explore the boundaries of the possible as a pastime, much of their

attention going to hopeful ideals and grand plans that may be hard to bring to

fruition. Down-to-earth Sentinels take a more conventional approach that honors the

value of procedure. The practical nature of their friendship helps to stabilize

Protagonists’ imaginative energy. They offer Protagonists joy by bringing grand

moments into focus.


Balance goes both ways: Whereas Protagonists are imaginative, their Sentinel friends

may be more comfortable with the way things are. This can make them reassuringly

dependable to Protagonists, but they may be more reluctant to engage in exciting

opportunities. Protagonists help their Sentinel friends see the benefits of

occasionally letting go of limits and exploring fun possibilities together. Both types

appreciate a structured approach, so even though one may lean heavily on

imagination and the other on tradition, they can plan things in a way that makes

them both happy. Protagonists may naturally take the lead in suggesting adventures,

but their solid sense of order can make experiences that are outside Sentinels’ usual

routines seem more comfortable.


                                 Solace and Support


This pair is also well suited to support each other through darker moments.

Protagonists’ imaginations can be a bottomless pit of worries when negative

emotions take over, and they regularly wear themselves down with their endless

drive. Sentinels are always ready to provide sensible advice; a plan; and a steady,

helping hand to overcome issues real or imagined. Sentinels also sensibly see when

it’s time to pull Protagonists back from stress and exhaustion into relaxation and fun.


In return, Protagonists not only offer ideas when their Sentinel friends have a

problem, they also offer emotional support from the heart. Protagonists can easily

tune into their friends’ feelings, sympathize with their woes, and respond with a care

that soothes their injury and promises brighter days ahead. And of course, once they

raise their friends’ spirits, this type’s brimming energy helps make things better.

Sentinels can tap into Protagonists’ forthright spirit to regain their own feet and

restore happiness.


             Unbalanced Protagonist–Sentinel Friendships

                                    Disrupted Rituals


Common values and interests may unite these two initially, but they may proceed in

different directions. When Protagonists try to infuse new elements into the

friendship (a frequent likelihood), they may find that Sentinels are resistant,

preferring to maintain their established pursuits together. This can gradually cause

Protagonists to feel bored and Sentinels to be irritated. Their shared Judging trait

may grant these friends some compatibility regarding how they engage experiences,

but it likely won’t rectify the differences between their Intuitive and Observant traits.


Protagonists are excited by possibility, always wanting to go out and grab

experiences that inspire their imaginations; they seek potential around every corner.

Even the most energetic Sentinels, on the other hand, find great satisfaction in happy

routines they’ve created; they’re not looking for excitement around every corner


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         95
                                                                              Friendships


because they find such satisfaction in the present. In everyday terms, these friends

may gradually spend less time together due to their different ways of finding fun.


                                       Revolution


Similarly, these two may not always agree on what’s right to strive for in life.

Protagonists are often deeply committed to fighting for their ideals against all odds,

even if those ideals are quite abstract. Sentinels, by contrast, are often deeply

principled but rarely see the value in producing intangible results – they want to

invest in a foundation that’s directly related to their daily lives. Protagonists may find

it difficult to draw Sentinel friends into their more revolutionary ideas, as people with

that personality type are unlikely to be interested in abstract concepts or stretched

profundity. As friends, these two may simply not see eye to eye, and when their

differences combine with their shared Judging trait, some truly stubborn judgment

may surface.


It’s not just about how they choose to live their own lives; how they engage things

together can be negatively affected. Even if their personal values and culture are very

similar, they may butt heads on everyday matters of idealism versus practicality, with

Protagonists zealously demanding what they think is right and Sentinels insisting on

what they see as realistic. Sentinels have little patience for what they see as wasted

effort, and Protagonists bristle against limits – so these friends can easily frustrate

each other.

               Rebalancing Protagonist–Sentinel Friendships

                                     Fun Together


One step toward closing the gap between Protagonists’ conceptual focus and

Sentinels’ fixed, practical view is to approach that difference with a sense of

acceptance and mutual respect. Sentinels and Protagonists value the well-being of

other people, especially close friends. This common ground bodes well for nurturing

their friendships. Sentinels can ask their Protagonist friends to take a deep breath

when they’re flush with a new idea or passion, and Protagonists can invite their

Sentinel friends into new experiences without pushing them too hard.


Understanding is only the first step; both friends can also work to recapture and

expand mutual interests. Something drew these two together in the first place, and

focusing on finding similar things to do together will reaffirm the friendship. With

their imaginations and bold energy, Protagonists should have little trouble thinking

up new ways to approach a favorite shared subject.


Both friends can also accord each other a little leeway. Rather than holding

stubbornly to personal preferences all the time, true friends find happiness by seeing

each other’s joy. To help resolve their different ideas into good times together, these

friends can:


   •   Identify one area of commonality (for example, you met in art class and both

       love art).

   •   Talk about new ways to share the subject together; make a list of ideas.

   •   Review the ideas in terms of preference, and identify ideas with the most

       commonality. (Perhaps one friend wants to fly to New York and tour art

       galleries, and the other would rather stay home and experiment with new


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        97
                                                                           Friendships


       sculpture techniques together, but both agree on a fun road trip to visit in-

       state galleries and sculpture gardens.)

   •   Engage the most mutual activities first, and work up to more significant

       compromises. Neither should feel pressured or obligated, but both can

       consider stepping out of their comfort zones for a friend.

   •   Try one of the fun activities together on a regular schedule. Once per week or

       once per month – it doesn’t matter, if the plan works for both friends and they

       commit to having fun together.


Although they can be stubborn, both types also firmly believe in being caring.

Compromising on their own desires sometimes is a great way to show that principle

in action.


                           Using the Benefits of Differences


Protagonists’ visionary flights of mind may not make much sense even to their closest

Sentinel friends, who simply aren’t prone to them. However, it’s precisely this

dynamic that can create a healthy counterbalance between the two. The key isn’t so

much in compromising their very different approaches – future versus present,

imagination versus practicality – but rather offering their unique and valuable

perspectives in service of each other’s goals.


When Protagonists see that their Sentinel friends are trying to accomplish

something, whether light or serious, they can offer their imaginative take and

dauntless energy to help achieve that goal. They are powerful allies, and bending an

unconventional approach to suit a conventional end – or vice versa – is a great way

for these friends to appreciate each other. Sentinels can, in turn, offer their




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       98

grounded, steady efforts to help Protagonists work toward their goals, no matter

how idealistic or even unrealistic they may seem.


Even if such dreams are out of reach, Protagonists will never forget that their Sentinel

friends stood by them; the support affirms their bond and is deeply meaningful to

Protagonists. And Sentinels may be surprised at just how attainable dreams can be,

with enough hope and effort shared between good friends. Both friends can consider

the following:


   •   Invite each other into a personal goal, whether recreational or not. (For

       example, a Protagonist friend may be trying to create a local disc-golf league,

       and a Sentinel may want to build an organic garden.)

   •   Spend a little time each week helping each other with whatever ideas,

       discussions, and direct help feel comfortable. Keep it fun and light.

   •   Remember that Sentinels’ studious approach and Protagonists’ outgoing

       social nature can provide balance. For example, the Sentinel might help the

       Protagonist tear through the tedium of creating and distributing flyers and

       posting on social media, and the Protagonist might provide energetic company

       during tours of organic agriculture facilities in the area.

   •   Try to be open to each other’s ideas, and at least try them out.

   •   Contribute unique ideas and approaches freely, but respect your friend’s

       choices about their own goals, and let them lead. If cheerful company and an

       extra set of hands are the only contributions, that’s still a win.

   •   Throughout the process, be aware of the unique advantages of each other’s

       approaches and methods. This is a chance to learn while having fun with a

       friend.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          99

Even though Protagonists and Sentinels may sometimes be caught off-guard by the

different ways they approach the world, helping each other with even casual goals

can go a long way toward creating shared understanding and joy.



                Protagonist–Explorer Friendships




Possibly one of the most interesting combinations of friends, Protagonists and

Explorers can find wonderful adventures together, and they may even enlighten each

other. Explorers are more adaptable than idealistic; highly pragmatic, they rarely

relate to the philosophical goals typical of Protagonists. Protagonists embrace long-

term dedication like a badge of honor, whereas Explorers nimbly adapt to suit

circumstances, comfortable with spontaneity and often immersed in the moment to

the exclusion of all else. Even though it is a seemingly odd pairing, any mutual

passion can quickly kindle a dynamic and inspired friendship.

               Balanced Protagonist–Explorer Friendships

                           Learning from Each Other’s Views


Protagonist–Explorer friendships offer both people wonderful opportunities to grow.

Protagonists can act as humanistic compasses for their Explorer friends by

reminding them of interconnected aspects of life, offering encouraging examples of

how to focus on personal goals while still considering a greater good. For novelty-

seeking Explorers, exploring the altruistic stimulates their sense of adventure, which

is especially fun if it involves working on a tangible project with rapid payoff.


Protagonists inspire Explorers to think more widely when they become too intent on

themselves, and Explorers center Protagonists who’ve lost touch with themselves in

their fervent pursuit of idealistic goals. Protagonists love to have fun, but they can

also be very serious, perhaps excessively. Determined ideas can dominate their

thinking; although laudable, their determination can bring stress, especially when it

pits them against other people.


Explorers are perfectly suited to bringing Protagonists out of their heads and into the

moment. The immediacy and often self-gratifying bent of Explorers’ outlook can offer

a needed break for Protagonists caught up in their intense thoughts. Explorers

cheerfully encourage them to relax and have fun, to stop and smell the roses as they

charge up the road of destiny.


                            Exploring the Unknown Together


In a way, both Protagonists and Explorers enjoy unconventional approaches to life:

Protagonists are warriors at heart, pushing for change in line with their beliefs and

always ready to challenge restrictive authority. In a similar vein, Explorers place

novelty and self-determination above all, disregarding rules and conventions in favor

of their own passions, quick to defy (or ignore) anyone who tries to restrict them.

Both are revolutionaries, in a way. This common ground provides opportunities for

them to stretch boundaries and gain something excitingly different through their

friendship.


Explorers love to take on new things by getting involved, and although Protagonists

may be a little more reserved when it comes to unexpected changes, they leap into

experiences that capture their interest. This is a recipe for good times and discovery

together: festivals, surfing, wine tasting, camping, pottery classes – they’ll happily

share any enriching activities. With Explorers’ openness to opportunity and

Protagonists’ willful imagination, these friends can share endless adventures.


              Unbalanced Protagonist–Explorer Friendships

                   Loose Spontaneity Clashing with Firm Dedication


Unfortunately, the ability of these types to connect through exciting pursuits doesn’t

always extend to the fundamental ways they engage life. Protagonists are planners

who follow through on their goals with lively energy. Explorers, on the other hand,

find little use in confining themselves to a preconceived track; they constantly adjust

not only their approach, but also their direction. When they feel uncomfortable

committing, it’s not because they won’t follow through or don’t care about a friend,

but rather because formalizing things can turn joys into obligations.


In a friendship, this subtle but powerful difference can come to the fore often,

whether they’re going out for coffee, planning a trip, or helping each other with

projects. When Protagonists place expectations of consistency on free-wheeling

Protagonists try to “keep them on track,” experiencing such intervention as a

limitation. Without some allowance and understanding, these friends may rile each

other even when attempting to carry out fun activities together.


                                     Don’t Judge Me!


Core differences can also affect how these friends gauge actions, personal interests,

and values. Protagonists sometimes overreach with their principled intentions,

pushing their views on others. Explorers, in contrast, maintain a “live and let live”

attitude, far more tolerant of other people’s differing views – they would rather not

get involved with things they don’t feel affect them. Protagonists are all about getting

involved though, rarely tolerant of anything they don’t agree with. Explorers may

criticize such interventions as unnecessary, foolish, even meddlesome, especially

when they are aimed at them.


Explorers are often quick to act on desires without much thought for future

consequences. In the grip of excitement, they tend to resent anyone who tries to

make them think twice about their decisions. Undaunted when they feel they are

acting on behalf of a friend, Protagonists may take their genuine concern too far, so

that it comes across as sanctimonious judgment. Explorers rebel wildly against this,

regardless of the intent behind it. The fastest way to lose such a friend is to try and

control them, but Protagonists have a very hard time allowing what they think is

wrong, especially if they feel a friend may be at risk.

                                      Committing to Fun


Both types can reconcile differing preferences by focusing on their appreciation for

each other. Protagonists can tap into their own bright-eyed enthusiasm for the future

and embrace a sense of fun as Explorers pull them out of their routine and place

them in the moment, where imagination and vigorous engagement – qualities that

Protagonists possess in abundance – are free to reign. Instead of resenting sudden

changes, Protagonists can focus on the friend they’re with, knowing that cheerfully

engaging the unexpected brings rewards of kinship and fun.


In addition to practicing some flexibility, Protagonists should be clear about how

much their commitments and values mean to them. Although spontaneity may be

thrilling, and Protagonists can handle change, sudden shifts sometimes leave them

feeling disappointed and stressed. Explorers care about their friends, so Protagonists

should share such feelings to ensure a balanced friendship. The following steps can

help:


   •    Agree whether time together will be loose or structured. A fun day of shopping

        is an opportunity for spontaneity, but a concert is an appropriate time for

        friends to stick to a plan.

   •    If commitment is difficult, say so up front. There’s nothing wrong with

        respectfully keeping options open.

   •    Don’t cancel plans with each other without notice and a good reason.

   •    When enjoying unstructured time together:

           o Pick a starting point together but then let things blossom as they will.

           o Go with the flow and cheerfully accept each other’s spontaneous ideas.

          o Focus on each other as much as the activity. Fun can be created

             between good friends regardless of what they’re doing.

          o Remember that any plan to “hang out” is still a promise to a friend.

   •   When enjoying a planned activity together:

          o Decide together on an activity or outing.

          o Agree on a time, then show up on schedule.

          o Stick with each other as planned.


If having something “their way” means the other friend isn’t having any fun, either

person can consider relaxing their own preferences for the sake of a friend.


                             Respecting Each Other’s Focus


Protagonists may not want to hear about the latest upgrades to an engine their

Explorer friends are raving about. Explorers may want to shrug off a conversation

about how producing the hamburger they’re eating uses the same amount of water

as a three-hour shower. However, good friends can suspend their disinterest to show

appreciation for each other. Protagonists may seem to drone on about the state of

the world, and Explorers just want to get their hands on that engine, but if Explorers

ask questions about the water crisis and Protagonists ask for an explanation of the

engine upgrades, both friends might be surprised how satisfying shared enthusiasm

can be.


Protagonists and Explorers can also choose to go along for the ride occasionally,

setting aside their own preferences temporarily. Friendship is a participatory sport:

If friends are rigid and disinterested in what excites each other, their friendships will

rest on an unstable foundation. Each friend may have to take a step outside their

comfort zone to share good times together. When one friend does so, the other can

make sure they show their appreciation for the respectful gesture, which reaffirms

and sustains the friendship itself. Some suggestions both friends can use:


   •   Ask to be invited into something your friend holds dear; it may be an

       explanatory conversation or an involved experience.

   •   Let your friend set the format for sharing their interest.

   •   Ask questions about what your friend gets out of it; try to understand their

       passion.

   •   Act like a polite guest, and don’t criticize their interest while trying it out.

   •   Express bright appreciation for any little aspect that seems inspiring or

       laudable – play up the positives.

   •   Discuss the experience afterward over coffee or a meal.

   •   Consider inviting your friend into one of your personal interests next time.


These friends can enjoy discovering what makes each other tick without marching to

the beat of the same drum. They may discover new ways to have fun together, as

enthusiasm can be infectious among good friends.

                          Finding Unexpected Strength in Others


Protagonists can spread and share in great joy by offering their amazing qualities to

any type through friendship. What remains for each Protagonist to decide is whether

they can be equally open to finding fulfillment and rewards in friendships with

different types of people. Protagonists excel at fostering positive change, and when

they also master the ability to honor and appreciate others for simply being who they

are, even if it represents something that departs from their own lifestyle, they open

doors to unexpected friendships that can change them for the better.


For some types, fun and laughter are enough to sustain lasting friendship. But for

Protagonists, a friend is someone they can hold close to their heart, who not only

offers them merriment and companionship, but also dares to inspire them beyond

their own limits. For this type, friendship is about a meeting of the minds and a solid,

reliable bond. As strong-willed, naturally social leaders, Protagonists benefit from

friends who have an equally strong sense of self, who can stand up to their

assumptions and give them guidance. Such friends become lifelong companions

during happy times and fun adventures, as well as sources of support when they

realize they need to lean on someone they can trust.

                 Romantic Relationships




                                  Depth and Dedication


Warm, caring, and capable of unconditional love, Protagonists can reach a level of

depth in their relationships most people only dream of. People with this personality

type take romance seriously, approaching it with true dedication and passion. Even

early in dating, Protagonists are willing to put in serious time and effort to foster their

relationships. They do everything in their power to encourage their partners’ growth

and success, and their dream is to fall in love with someone who supports their own

growth in return. Although they can be picky, Protagonists crave romantic

connection, and when they find someone they truly respect, they aren’t afraid to

commit.


Protagonists’ relationships are founded on generosity, dedication, and emotional

honesty. Curious and perceptive, Protagonists can often detect subtle changes in

their partners, to the extent that they might seem to read minds. That said, people

of this type aren’t afraid to ask outright how their partners feel about the

relationship. If status checks don’t become too frequent or overbearing, they can



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          108
                                                                Romantic Relationships


help Protagonists and their partners identify and resolve potential issues, rather than

letting them fester.


Due to this extraordinary level of emotional investment, breakups can trigger a

tremendous sense of guilt and betrayal in Protagonists – even after relatively short

relationships. When this happens, it’s often because Protagonists have become

invested in the idea of the relationship in addition to the reality. They may have lost

sight of the person in front of them, focusing instead on their visions of how they and

a partner could develop together. As they grow, people with this personality type

must learn to distinguish between idealizations of their romantic future and the

refuge of true love.


                                      Going Deep


Whether early in the dating process or later in a relationship, Protagonists aren’t

satisfied by small talk. What interests them are ideas and beliefs, goals and dreams.

When romantic partners won’t communicate at that level, people with this

personality type quickly lose interest.


Like many people with the Intuitive trait, Protagonists don’t believe in “leaving well

enough alone.” Instead, they want their relationships, and the people in them, to

grow. They look for ways to improve their connections and deepen their love, and

they expect their partners to do the same, rather than settling for the status quo.

Although this relentless desire to grow can sometimes be irritating, it motivates

Protagonists to bring their best selves – sincere, earnest, and caring – to their

relationships.

                                    On a Pedestal


Ultimately, Protagonists want to find a soul mate. Whereas Analysts crave intellectual

stimulation, Explorers seek fun, and Sentinels cherish stability, people with this

personality type are looking for something else: a connection at the deepest level.

When they feel that level of connection, Protagonists’ dedication and passion are

nothing short of remarkable. If left unchecked, however, their romantic idealism can

go into overdrive, leading them to value a partner’s potential – to grow into a kinder,

deeper, more self-actualized person – rather than the actual person by their side.


Alas, this is rarely the recipe for an equitable relationship. Protagonists may push

their partners to change, becoming frustrated when their partners don’t work (or

seem to work) to improve themselves. However well intended, this behavior can

make their partners feel judged, pushed around, or resentful. Unless Protagonists

respect their partners’ willingness – or lack thereof – to change, they risk driving a

wedge between themselves and the person they love.



                   Potential Pairings by Role
Cultivating a satisfying relationship isn’t always easy, especially for a type so

concerned with depth and authenticity. Whether in romantic partnerships or other

aspects of their lives, Protagonists won’t settle for the status quo at the expense of

growth and discovery. As a result, they aren’t content with partnerships that –

however comfortable or convenient – don’t move them at a deep level.


Fortunately, every personality type has something to contribute, and as Protagonists

date and pursue long-term relationships, they find many opportunities for

meaningful connection. This section explains common patterns in relationships

between Protagonists and each of the different role groups – Analysts, other

Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers. By understanding such patterns, people with

this personality type can approach their romantic lives with awareness, insight, and

compassion, maximizing their chances of finding and sustaining meaningful, loving

partnerships.



                Protagonist–Analyst Relationships




Comfortable with ideas and abstractions, Protagonists and Analysts share a

visionary, open-minded view of the world. Despite their shared interest in creativity

and inspiration, they aren’t identical – in this relationship, each partner offers

strengths and capabilities that don’t come naturally to the other. Whereas

Protagonists enjoy profound human insight, Analysts excel at improving systems and

assessing situations objectively. As time progresses, their differing perspectives can

enable Protagonists and Analysts to balance each other’s weaknesses and bring out

the best in each other, creating vital bonds of mutual respect and trust.

              Balanced Protagonist–Analyst Relationships

                                      Deep Thinkers


Like Protagonists, Analysts love bold, original thinking. Neither has much patience

for small talk – they want to go deep. Some people might say, “We don’t discuss

religion or politics at the dinner table,” but these Intuitive types might both respond,

“Then what is there to talk about?” Protagonists delve into the human side of issues,

and Analysts push for thorough, logical understanding. When they value their

differing perspectives as complementary rather than incompatible, the result is lively,

meaningful conversation.


Given their creative, imaginative minds, these types find endless subjects to discuss.

Topics that combine technology and human progress – for example, using social

media to apply pressure to oppressive regimes or corrupt institutions – can keep

these types talking for months, as can more personal discussions about goals and

dreams. Far from fleeting chit-chat, these conversations reignite the sparks between

Protagonists and Analysts, fostering respect, affection, and mutual curiosity even as

the relationship progresses.


                                 Emotion and Rationality


Protagonists bring warmth and emotion to their relationships – qualities that

Analysts often struggle to show. Leading by example, Protagonists help their

partners better understand not just sensitivity and romance, but also the value of

human connection on a deeper level. With Protagonists’ help, Analysts reap the

rewards of an emotional attunement that transcends the limitations of pure logic.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      112

In turn, Protagonists are often amazed by their Analyst partners’ ability to wrangle

with big ideas in a rational way. In healthy relationships, Analysts offer reasoned,

thoughtful stances on difficult, complex decisions, from which house to buy to

whether to move across the world. Unlike some other types, however, Analysts can

offer logical viewpoints without curtailing a shared sense of progress and possibility.

The result is a beautiful counterpoint to Protagonists’ idealistic – and at times

unrealistic – fervor.


             Unbalanced Protagonist–Analyst Relationships

                                   Routine Roulette


Despite their facility with grand visions and big ideas, Protagonist–Analyst couples

can falter in the face of everyday routines. These types encourage each other’s grand

aspirations, which is beautiful – unless it prevents them from managing their shared

responsibilities. Such issues may not be evident early in a relationship, when these

two revel in novelty and possibility. In fact, newly partnered Protagonists and

Analysts might roll their eyes at couples who create chore charts or devote their

weekends to running errands.


If these two move in together, however, the demands of everyday life can trigger a

surprising amount of stress. Simple tasks such as taking out the trash, paying bills,

and stocking the fridge create tension and disagreement if no one routinely handles

them. Unless these partners temper their big-picture perspectives with a willingness

to take care of necessities, the resulting accumulation of neglected chores can

compromise not only their grand plans, but also their equanimity.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       113

                                The Head and the Heart


Protagonists lead from the heart, and they appreciate romantic gestures – whether

in the form of flowers on Valentine’s Day or long, sentimental messages in greeting

cards. Alas, many Analysts see such gestures as pointless. Why spend money on a

bouquet of flowers that will wither within days?


During the dating stage, Analyst partners might successfully “fake” some of the

sentimental rituals of courtship. Soon enough, however, Protagonists may detect

when a gesture doesn’t come from the heart, and they may feel disappointed, much

to Analysts’ chagrin. When Analysts perform a romantic gesture, it is solely to make

a partner happy: If they’ve gone through the motions of buying flowers, they expect

their partner to feel pleased, not disappointed. This gap might seem like a superficial

obstacle, but demonstrations of emotional support and connection mean a great

deal to Protagonists – something that Analysts may struggle to understand.


This dynamic can manifest in many areas of life. After a hard, draining day,

Protagonists want their partners to listen, validate their feelings, and empathize with

them, whereas Analysts might rush in to suggest logical solutions. Faced with an

onslaught of suggestions, Protagonists may feel as if they’re being invalidated or even

criticized for not pursuing solutions that seem obvious to their Analyst partners. Even

though Analysts are trying to help, their default is to approach issues with their heads

rather than their hearts, and sensitive Protagonists may feel hurt as a result.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        114

             Rebalancing Protagonist–Analyst Relationships

                                The Dreaded Chore Chart


On the practical front, Protagonist–Analyst couples should address chores and

responsibilities head-on. If they ignore their to-do lists for too long – or put off making

to-do lists altogether – they will find themselves mired in unnecessary stress, which

inevitably takes its toll on the relationship. Something as trivial as having nothing to

cook for dinner can trigger an argument at the end of a long day.


Fortunately, this couple doesn’t have to spend all their free time on chores, nor

should they. Instead, they can create calendar reminders for recurring tasks, such as

picking up groceries; establish automatic bill payments; or outsource certain tasks,

such as lawn maintenance or home cleaning, if resources permit.


The couple may also want to avoid taking on too many projects or products that

require routine maintenance, from “fixer-upper” houses to additional cars. Keeping

life simple is the name of the game. By minimizing the number of claims on their

time and attention, they free up time to learn and grow together. Some suggestions

to do so:


   •   Set aside a time to discuss household responsibilities – an hour should suffice.

       (The process is more pleasant with snacks.)

   •   Discuss each partner’s vision for a well-run, well-maintained life. How clean

       must the house or apartment be? How often must laundry be done?

   •   List every recurring chore, sorting them into the following categories: finances,

       cleaning and laundry, home maintenance, shopping and errands, and

       miscellaneous. If relevant, add child care, yard maintenance, car maintenance,

       and any responsibilities unique to your shared lifestyle.

   •   Circle every item that can be automated, such as paying bills or setting aside

       a certain amount of money from each paycheck for retirement. Decide which

       partner will set up these automations and mutually determine a deadline for

       doing so. If possible, tackle the tasks in the moment, while the inspiration to

       do so is fresh.

   •   Cross out sources of “chore stress” that can be eliminated, such as underused

       tools, unworn clothes, or unloved clutter that just fills up the cabinets and

       accumulates dust. Plan how to dispose of the items appropriately.

   •   Divide the remaining tasks, mutually agreeing on who will take care of what

       and how frequently. Set aside some chores to do together, and find ways to

       make them relatively enjoyable – such as putting on music or pairing a trip to

       the hardware store with a visit to a pizza parlor.

   •   Every week, revisit the list and decide which tasks will be prioritized for the

       days ahead. Schedule time to take care of them.


When dividing chores, partners can volunteer to take on more responsibility in areas

that suit them. Protagonists might feel drawn to teacher conferences, whereas

Analysts might enjoy tackling more technical areas such as auto or bicycle

maintenance.


                                    Getting Support


Analysts genuinely want to support their Protagonist partners. By default, they offer

suggestions and solutions rather than empathy and romantic gestures. Like any type,

Analysts hate to see the people they love in pain, and that feeling compels them to

jump in with ideas when their partner has had a bad day. Unfortunately, Protagonists

might not be able to detect the good intentions beneath Analysts’ “Why don’t you just

…” – particularly when they’re already feeling hurt or vulnerable and looking for


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     116

sympathy. The result is hurt feelings on both sides, even though Analysts might not

let on that it bothers them when their well-meant suggestions are cast aside.


To bridge this divide, Protagonists may need to consciously remind themselves that

their partners just want them to be happy. It’s possible to misinterpret Analysts’

communication style as judgmental or uncaring even when they’re trying to be

helpful, as these types aren’t fluent in the warm expressions and compassionate

gestures that come so naturally to Protagonists. When Protagonists want support,

they may have to specify their exact needs rather than expect their Analyst partners

to know how to soothe them. The following tips may help:


   •   Ask for a listening ear. Clarify your needs: “I just had the worst argument with

       my sister, and I need to get it off my chest.” This clarifies that the goal of the

       conversation is an improved mental or emotional state, not a solution or an

       action plan.

   •   If your Analyst partner interrupts with suggestions, respond by saying, “I’m so

       grateful you want to help. I’ll only feel worse if this conversation becomes a to-

       do list. Can we save the problem-solving for another time?” Or “Right now I just

       want to talk it through. Figuring out what to do can come later.” Analysts

       respect this kind of independence.

   •   Offer thanks and appreciation for your Analyst partner’s time and care.

       Analysts aren’t emotional mind readers, so explain how their presence and

       support – and restraint – have been helpful and meaningful.


By modifying their communication style, Protagonists can create conditions that

allow their Analyst partners to offer sincere care. Even when Analysts do step in with

suggestions rather than empathy, Protagonists can recognize and appreciate the

ways they show they care. By recognizing the loving energy that motivates Analysts’

behavior, Protagonists can find emotional healing in even their partners’ most

practical contributions.



               Protagonist–Diplomat Relationships




Protagonists and their Diplomat partners inspire each other’s imaginations. These

two find common ground naturally thanks to shared values, including compassion

and self-development. They are also poised to understand and appreciate each

other’s creative pursuits, passions, and dreams. Together, Protagonists and

Diplomats can foster a beautifully supportive relationship, with each partner

validating aspects of the other’s personality that much of the world would dismiss as

overly idealistic or impractical.

                               The Beauty of Their Dreams


Diplomats are exceptionally attuned to others’ thoughts and emotions, which can be

a blessing, but it also means that they are acutely sensitive to slights – or even

perceived slights – from other people. As a result, they may hesitate to share their

innermost longings with people who seem to value efficiency, security, or adrenaline

rushes over the magic of art or the thrill of true human connection.


Therefore, in the early stages of a relationship between a Protagonist and another

Diplomat, the two are likely over the moon to finally find someone who seems to

understand their life philosophy. These two understand each other’s sensitivities, so

they know how to encourage rather than stifle each other’s seeds of dreams –

whether writing a novel, founding a nonprofit, or living overseas. Sharing their

desires with each other can be a cathartic, profoundly validating experience, one that

transforms the bonds of attraction and affection into something more enduring.


As the relationship matures, Protagonists and Diplomats can gently encourage each

other to follow through on their longings rather than doubt them or let them languish

in the idea phase. Although execution may not come naturally to these two, they

blossom in the presence of people who believe in them. By admiring and

encouraging each other’s aspirations, Protagonists and Diplomats can remind one

another of the beauty of their dreams. In this way, they not only support each other’s

growth, but also grow closer as a couple.


                            Compassion and Communion


A sense of unity grows quickly in Protagonist–Diplomat relationships. Over time,

unity develops into subtle intensity and loyalty that may not be visible to outsiders

but is felt deeply between the partners. The source of their connection is the couple’s

exceptional compassion, which motivates them to understand and accommodate

each other at a profound level.


Early in a relationship, this understanding may be shallower than either partner

realizes. What is remarkable about this couple, however, is that as they get to know


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       119

each other better, their appreciation often increases. They see growth as a virtue,

accepting their partners as nuanced human beings – beautiful as they are, and yet

works in progress. By creating an environment where each partner feels seen, heard,

and accepted, these two can enjoy a connection that is founded on a deep desire for

understanding. This is a relationship in which each person feels free to inhabit their

authentic selves – especially vital for Diplomats.


                                    Dream It, Do It


Among Diplomats, Protagonists are relatively action oriented. Sure, they can spend

hours (or weeks) dreaming up visions for a better future, but they also care about

taking steps to turn their dreams into reality. This is a wonderful strength to

contribute to a Diplomat–Diplomat relationship, as other Diplomats may struggle to

act on their grand ideas. Together, Protagonist–Diplomat couples can look beyond

the status quo and recognize potential and possibility where others don’t see it. And

thanks to Protagonists’ influence, they can bridge the gap between dreaming and

taking action.


In turn, other types of Diplomats can help Protagonists slow down and take a break.

Protagonists are nothing if not driven, and although this trait makes them effective,

it can also lead to exhaustion, burnout, and wasted energy. Other Diplomats offer a

beautiful counterpoint, gently encouraging Protagonists to take a day off from their

missions and engagements every now and again. Downtime can renew a couple’s

sense of connection, allowing them to set aside time and energy to deepen their

intellectual, emotional, and physical intimacy.

           Unbalanced Protagonist–Diplomat Relationships

                                       Too Much


If Protagonists don’t balance their individual needs with the needs of the relationship,

a deep connection can be subsumed by an overwhelming sense of enmeshment. Too

much togetherness with Diplomat partners can feel stifling, particularly if it prevents

Protagonists from pursuing their individual interests and developing their own views

and opinions. As they pursue their personal goals for self-development, Protagonists

need the space and latitude to set aside others’ expectations and be their true selves.


Likewise, they expect their partners to chart their own courses for self-development.

When partners fail to do so – or rather, when they don’t conform to Protagonists’

vision of what it means to pursue self-development – Protagonists may become

restless and impatient. Gradually, they can lose respect, wondering why their

partners can’t be more independent, autonomous, or self-possessed. Alas,

Diplomats will almost certainly pick up on such judgments, reducing trust and

intimacy in the relationship. This can become a vicious cycle, with sensitive Diplomat

partners engaging in clingy, needy, or codependent behavior in a decidedly

unproductive effort to regain Protagonists’ approval.


                                     White Knights


Protagonist–Diplomat couples may struggle with their idealistic expectations about

relationships. In the dating phase, they might interpret shared interests and

surprisingly honest conversations – about their lives, their hopes, and the hardships

they’ve faced – as stand-ins for compatibility and connection. They may even place

each other on pedestals, romanticizing and idealizing their relationship before it has

truly begun. Alas, just as no person is perfect, no relationship is either. All couples


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        121

experience conflict, and lasting connection requires awareness, effort, and daily

commitment. Most importantly, true happiness can’t be found in another person.


This reality can be uncomfortable for any Protagonists and Diplomats who expect

another person to “complete them” or who expect a relationship to salve their

emotional wounds. In the early days of a relationship, things may indeed seem

perfect. But over time, issues inevitably arise – and not just in the form of

disagreements (although those are also inevitable). One person might lose a parent

or experience a significant setback at work and be dismayed to find that the other

partner’s love and compassion can’t heal their grief or relieve their stress.

Protagonists in particular may feel let down if they believe their partners aren’t taking

clear actions to offer support. When their partner doesn’t protect them from

emotional or existential pain, they may call the relationship itself into question as a

result.


                                  Unfinished Business


On a more practical level, life organization may pose a problem for Protagonists with

Diplomat partners, even if other aspects of their shared lives seem ideal. Thanks to

their Intuitive and Feeling traits, these couples feel drawn to big ideas and dreams

about the future. Paying the electric bill, maintaining a budget, or completing the final

stages of a home improvement can slip right off their radar.


As a result, these two may sail along smoothly when their main worry is fostering

their new relationship, but when they move in together, couple their finances, and

share domestic responsibilities, the pressure can mount. Whose responsibility is it to

take out the recycling? How much debt is accumulating on the credit card? When was

the car supposed to get an oil change again? Faced with these common challenges,



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        122

the couple may feel overwhelmed, retreating deeper into procrastination – which

only triggers more anxiety and tension in the long run.


           Rebalancing Protagonist–Diplomat Relationships

                                    Space and Time


Protagonist–Diplomat couples, with their constant focus on each other’s feelings,

sometimes forget that they don’t need to spend every moment together, nor do they

have to step in and help whenever their partner feels down. Emotions come in waves,

and sometimes people do best when allowed to process and release their feelings

on their own. These partners, like all couples, occasionally need to offer each other

space and take time to themselves.


If two people pursue different hobbies, disagree on certain topics, or process some

of their issues on their own, it doesn’t mean the relationship is doomed. In fact,

moments of independence foster a more sustainable bond between partners,

allowing them to enjoy a meaningful connection without being subsumed by it. That

said, Diplomats might (understandably) take it personally if their partner suggests

spending more time apart. It’s best to initiate such changes casually and agreeably,

not within the context of a fight or argument. Some suggestions toward that end:


   •   Announce the change in a cheerful, good-natured way, taking care not to say

       anything that could be interpreted as critical.

   •   If possible, suggest a joint activity for another time: “I’m going to the park for

       the pickup basketball game. Want to get dinner together afterward?”

   •   Frame the change as an opportunity for mutual support. After all, time apart

       can benefit both partners: Introverted partners get the gift of alone time to




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        123
                                                                Romantic Relationships


       curl up with a good book or contemplate the world, and Extraverted partners

       can cultivate their own friendships and connections.

   •   If tension or resistance arises, defuse it by explaining the emotional and

       mental benefits of meeting new people and getting into a group. “Playing

       basketball used to make me feel so strong and confident, and I’d really like to

       make some new friends in the neighborhood.” Diplomats want to help, and if

       they understand the benefit of allowing their partners more space, they’ll be

       motivated to do it.


Both Protagonists and their Diplomat partners can find opportunities to

communicate that they need their space without it feeling like a rejection.

Protagonists can also temper their expectations with appreciation, recognizing how

rare it is to find a partner who wants to help them as much as a Diplomat does.


                                    No Airbrushing


Relationships may seem to be the answer to everything. Gorgeous, courageous, and

smart, our partners sweep us off our feet, see the inner beauty that others missed,

and make our hearts whole again. They comfort us when we’re sad, provide for us

when we’re broke, and make every day into a waking adventure. It’s like that line from

Jerry Maguire: “You complete me.”


Yes, we can roll our eyes at these over-the-top idealizations, but thanks to

advertising, social media, and perhaps even the people in our lives, these dreams

linger in our unconscious minds. The result is a black-and-white dynamic where

either we’ve found our perfect match, or we haven’t. Protagonists and other

Diplomats can be especially susceptible to this type of thinking, mentally

“airbrushing” their partners and indulging in unrealistic expectations. Then, when



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      124

their partners – inevitably – let them down, these types might call an entire

relationship into question.


To combat this phenomenon, Protagonists can start by acknowledging their own

missteps, weaknesses, and personal difficulties in a healthy, balanced way. This

fosters a sense of safety and openness in the relationship, allowing partners to

cultivate true empathy and respect for each other.


   •   When appropriate, acknowledge mistakes and personal struggles – without

       fishing for validation or going overboard.

   •   Don’t expect reciprocation (in other words, your Diplomat partner

       immediately acknowledging their own weaknesses). Instead, view this as an

       opportunity to increase the honesty, depth, and realness of the relationship –

       a time for both partners to release the need to be (or appear to be) perfect.

   •   Notice how your Diplomat partner conveys support, encouragement, and

       acceptance.

   •   In time, when your Diplomat partner expresses their own weaknesses, mirror

       the support they offered to you in the past.

   •   Remember that these areas for growth are part of the human condition; as

       such, they allow us to feel true empathy toward one another.


Expressions of vulnerability open a space for both partners to be honest and real

rather than defensive or judgmental. No one is perfect, and by acknowledging this in

a balanced, nonjudgmental way, we create relationships where empathy and

authenticity can thrive.

                                 Procrastination Begone


When this couple senses a lack of connection with each other, the issue may have

surprisingly tangible roots. Even for these big-picture thinkers, heaps of unopened

mail, half-finished home-improvement projects, and overflowing trash cans create

stress. Add in some tension over who should do what, and there’s a recipe for a

frazzled, disconnected couple.


Protagonists can actively encourage their Diplomat partners – and themselves – to

attend to practical matters. Deep, meaningful conversations can be immensely

rewarding, but sometimes it’s necessary to sit down and pay the bills. These partners

may be more focused on higher personal goals than laundry, but by forming an

understanding and following through, they can support each other’s attention to

mundane responsibilities. Here are some steps to address the issue:


   •   Set aside an hour or two. Sit together in a comfortable place with a notebook

       and pen.

   •   Have each partner envision and share how they would feel and what they

       would do without the weight of unfinished business hanging over them. Jot

       down notes.

          o Would they feel more inspired to create?

          o Would it be easier for them to access their craft supplies?

   •   Commit to tackling unfinished business as a team. Maybe even create a team

       name, if it’s motivational.

   •   Create an informal accountability agreement, a promise between partners to

       help with chores and old to-do items so that both can enjoy a happier, more

       relaxing life together. Have each partner voice a promise.

   •   List each item of unfinished business, from washing the dirty dishes in the sink

       to calling the roofer for an estimate.

   •   Decide who will be responsible for each item and when they will take care of

       it. Prioritize essential tasks (paying bills) over somewhat optional ones

       (weeding the garden).

          o Don’t over-commit.

          o Automate recurring items whenever possible.

          o Commit to revisiting this list at the same time every week and adjusting

              it as necessary - with practice, the process will become quicker and

              easier.

   •   Stick to the plan.

          o Thank each other for contributions.

          o Regularly revisit the notes from step two.

          o Reconnect to this spirit of working together to create a better future.

   •   When possible, tackle chores as a team. Doing the dishes together can

       transform a tedious chore to a chance to bump shoulders and laugh.


Clearing away a list of old chores can be remarkably refreshing, and this couple may

find that with their kitchen clean and their bills settled, they suddenly feel freer to

live the lives they want, whether planting the seeds of a new endeavor or by enjoying

the fruits of their hard work.

               Protagonist–Sentinel Relationships




Protagonists and Sentinels find common ground in their drive to help others.

Sentinels do this by creating and preserving stability, ensuring that the ground is firm

beneath their loved ones’ feet. Protagonists foster values and offer emotional

support, aiming to make the world beautiful and just for those they love. Together,

this couple can enjoy the incredible satisfaction that comes from mutual support and

wholehearted living.

                              Dedication and Good Sense


Although Protagonists might not always want to keep their feet on the ground, they

may come to appreciate the order and structure that Sentinels bring to a

relationship. Beneath their romantic longings, Protagonists crave someone

dependable and steadfast, someone who can weather storms by their side. Sentinels

can fit this bill beautifully; they view loyalty as essential to a balanced relationship

and commit fully once they find the right person.

By drawing on each other’s strengths, this couple can balance the comfort of

constancy with the challenge (and delight) of necessary change. Although they value

the status quo, Sentinels are hardly intent on discouraging their partners – in fact,

they can serve as great sounding boards, helping Protagonists distinguish inspiration

from fantasy. Whether Protagonists long to take a road trip across the United States

or start an animal shelter, they can count on Sentinels’ good sense and practical

clarity. This couple functions best when they strive to appreciate each other’s dreams

and goals – they can accomplish this by looking for common ground, rather than

differences, in envisioning a good life.


                               Inspiration and Execution


Protagonists may be pleasantly surprised to find that their imagination and idealism

are attractive to pragmatic-minded Sentinels. Even Sentinels can enjoy broadening

their comfort zones and discovering new delights, and Protagonists love to step in

and share the things that matter to them, from music to mountain vistas. Although

such gestures might seem small from the outside, they can become part of the

couple’s shared identity, reinforcing their appreciation for each other and renewing

their curiosity about each other’s opinions, ideas, and viewpoints.


When Protagonists balance their unabashed revolutionary voice with love and

respect, Sentinels feel welcome to expand their thinking and consider new

perspectives. Protagonists bring a breath of fresh air to the staid mentality of some

Sentinels, infusing their interactions with hope, encouragement, and energy. With

Protagonist partners, Sentinels think bigger than they might on their own, while

bringing in the grounded attention necessary to see whether the details really can

line up. Together, this couple can enjoy all the phases of life together, with

Protagonists delighting in sharing new things with their partners and Sentinels

most.


            Unbalanced Protagonist–Sentinel Relationships

                              Mistaking What’s Practical


Once the novelty of inspiration wears off, Protagonists may find their Sentinel

partners questioning the practicality of their ideas. When Protagonists launch into

yet another notion on how to better the future or rearrange the world, their Sentinel

partners might groan, “Enough already.” Sentinels may mistake Protagonists’

multitude of interests and involvements as shallowness or disorganization. This can

undermine Protagonists’ vision of themselves as capable and effective.


The difference between what’s practical and what’s not is often a matter of opinion.

Sentinels live by fixed rules and traditions, and they organize the world around them

in common-sense, day-to-day ways. Protagonists’ creativity and lofty imagination

may seem immature or impractical to them, especially when Protagonists challenge

rules or goals that Sentinels see as necessary. If both partners insist on being right,

their differences of opinion can trigger significant imbalances, eroding the respect

and goodwill that form the bedrock of a supportive relationship.


                                   You Want What?


Given Sentinels’ attention to detail and tradition, Protagonists may be frustrated by

what seems like a lack of vision. How can their partners become so lost in the nitty-

gritty of everyday life and the status quo? Protagonists become bored with

conversations that are all about who did what, and when such-and-such is due, and

did you see what she wore to the wedding? Especially restless, growth-oriented



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       130

Protagonists may start to see their romantic partners as unimaginative or somehow

stunted.


Although the mismatch might not be evident in the earliest days of the partnership,

Sentinels’ and Protagonists’ differing priorities can cause tension as the relationship

matures. Just as Protagonists seek even deeper and more meaningful interactions,

Sentinels are getting comfortable enough to relax into a stable routine – and expect

their partners to settle down accordingly.


Sentinels often have a timeline for when they expect to move in together, get

married, buy a home together, have children, and so on. When Protagonists talk

about transforming the relationship or soul-searching – their own spin on routine –

Sentinels may mistake that desire for disloyalty to the relationship and a violation of

how things “should” progress. This dynamic causes hurt on both sides, robbing this

couple of the sense that they are growing together over time.


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Sentinel Relationships

                                       Back It Up


Although they might resent or dismiss Sentinels’ practical mindset at first,

Protagonists can come to appreciate it. Sentinel partners offer a pragmatic

counterpoint that can support Protagonists’ growth toward the loftiest heights – and

even better, it can enable them to grow together. Even with Sentinels’ support,

however, Protagonists might not deliver on their ideas. This creates two problems:

On one hand, it bothers ever-conscientious Sentinels, and on the other, it tarnishes

Protagonists’ self-respect.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      131

To bridge this divide, Protagonists may want to let their partners take the lead, at

least in small ways: a weekly meal plan, for instance, or a checklist for the morning

routine. With Sentinels creating stability and order, Protagonists may feel clearer-

headed, more relaxed, and more capable of the follow-through that their ideas

require – which, it just so happens, is also the follow-through that their Sentinel

partners expect. When Protagonists deliver on their dreams, their self-image

improves alongside their gratitude for their partners. When they express this

appreciation, they bolster Sentinels’ spirits, which strengthens the relationship. Some

suggestions for Protagonists who wish to merge the two approaches:


   •   When expressing a far-fetched, transitory idea, clarify that it’s just a thought

       experiment. Although Sentinels may not enjoy that kind of conversation, they

       appreciate knowing whether an idea is going to become a plan.

   •   If the idea is serious, ask for feedback: “I want to start a business, and I think I

       could register my trade name with the county within a week. Do you think

       that’s reasonable?”

   •   Establish a timeline, and explain exactly what kind of accountability or support

       would be helpful. “Would you check in with me then to see if I’ve done it? If I

       fall behind, would you help me create a new schedule?”

   •   When things go wrong, be honest and ask for help: “I know I’m way behind,

       and I’m pretty sure I’ve lost at least half of the paperwork. What do you

       recommend?” Sentinels shine in such situations.

   •   Express appreciation and affection for the support and assistance.


Protagonists love to open hearts and minds, and Sentinels can help them be

compatible with the world around them. Thanks to a combination of vision and

consistency, these couples can support each other through all kinds of endeavors,

both large and small.


                                  Gentle Reassurance


When Sentinels resist Protagonists’ thirst for transformation and improvement, it’s

not just because they enjoy the status quo – it’s also because they’re afraid their

partners will leave them behind. Sentinels may worry that a conversation about

moving to a new city or taking up a new hobby will catalyze a chain of events that

ends with their Protagonist partner falling out of love, meeting someone new, or

otherwise abandoning the plans they’ve made together. On a smaller scale, Sentinels

may feel “forgotten about” when their partner does new things without them.

Sentinels crave security, which is one reason they create mental timelines of how a

relationship “should” progress. If they hit each milestone, they reason, that means

their life and their relationship are successful. When these types feel vulnerable – for

example, when a Protagonist partner suggests a change to the relationship – they

cling to their own plans and expectations more tightly.


Once Protagonists appreciate that their partners aren’t just being stubborn, they can

use their emotional attunement to reassure and include their Sentinel partners

whenever they suggest changes. This includes speculative, idle conversations about

moving, taking on a new position, or even going new places, as Sentinels might

assume that Protagonists intend to follow through on their ideas. Although such

conversations are exciting to Protagonists, they can trigger fear, anxiety, and

uncertainty among insecure Sentinels.


When Protagonists bring change to Sentinels’ doorsteps, they can reassure their

partners and coax them out of their shells a little at a time by using a gentle,



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        133
                                                                  Romantic Relationships


understanding manner, not to mention a reasonably detailed explanation of the

change’s practical consequences. Just as importantly, Protagonists can involve their

partners in decision-making. By asking for feedback and suggestions on how to

implement an idea, Protagonists can draw on their Sentinel partners’ incredible

strengths – including their pragmatic mindset and their attention to detail. At the

same time, this approach allows Protagonists to reassure the person they love that

they won’t be left behind.


Consider the following:


   •   Before suggesting a change or initiating a soul-searching conversation,

       consider whether it might be interpreted as a criticism or an invalidation of

       your Sentinel partner’s desires, plans, and preferences. If so, reframe the

       conversation in a way that demonstrates commitment and supports the

       relationship. For example, moving can be viewed as an opportunity to

       establish a home together.

   •   If possible, suggest changes only when the environment and mood are

       conducive to conversation. Traffic jams, crowded places, and the harried few

       minutes before rushing off to work don’t provide the best circumstances.

   •   Lead off by explaining the tangible benefits of the change: “I’ve been thinking

       about going back to school because I think it could open up some new areas

       for professional growth and help me advance in my career.”

   •   Offer a plan that describes the time and resources that the change would

       demand – in other words, a budget and a timeline. This clarity prevents your

       partner from overestimating the impact of the change.

   •   Ask your Sentinel partner: “How do you feel about this?”




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        134
                                                               Romantic Relationships


   •   Ask for feedback on the idea and really listen. The goal is to foster open

       communication and trust, not to be right (or prove the other person wrong).

   •   Ask for help implementing or (if appropriate) further researching the change.

       Emphasize a desire to move forward and develop together as a couple rather

       than grow apart.

   •   Remember that Sentinels might experience anxiety when faced with change,

       so remain attuned to their emotional state. If the conversation becomes too

       stressful, suggest adjourning it until another time.

   •   End the conversation by expressing gratitude and affection.


When Protagonists reassure their Sentinel partners, they initiate a virtuous cycle. As

Sentinel partners come to understand that the relationship offers deep security and

support, they become less rigid about their approach to life in other areas, thereby

preventing future tension and unease.



               Protagonist–Explorer Relationships




When Protagonists and Explorers find themselves on a date, they discover subtle and

not-so-subtle differences between themselves. Explorers are curious about

everything, but they become impatient when Protagonists talk about abstractions,


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      135

values, and philosophies for hours (or days). Provided they appreciate this difference,

this couple can thrive on discovery, excitement, and pleasure, enjoying the very best

of what life has to offer.


              Balanced Protagonist–Explorer Relationships

                                         Red Hot


In the early days of this relationship, sparks fly. Fascinated by Explorers’ free spirits

and their passionate authenticity, Protagonists detect – or perhaps project – an aura

of romance around these adventuresome partners. Explorers come on strong, and

Protagonists bask in their energy and attention, immersing themselves fully into the

relationship. These two may feel drawn to see each other every day, thrumming with

excitement and anticipation as the hour for their date draws near.


Over time, this initial attraction can deepen into true passion. Protagonists’ warm,

consistent support can help heal any wounds in Explorers’ self-esteem or self-image

– a dynamic that both partners find gratifying. Meanwhile, Protagonists may be truly

touched by the way Explorers feel moved to share the world with them, as Explorers

constantly look out for new restaurants, vacations, places, and experiences that the

couple can enjoy together. When the initial sparks fade, this combination of

consistent support and shared novelty can reinvigorate this relationship through

every stage of life.


                                  A Whole New World


With Explorer partners, Protagonists may start to feel their options in life opening.

Explorers’ spontaneity – for example, sunset dips in the ocean or spur-of-the-

moment camping trips – can revive Protagonists’ joie de vivre, helping them to release



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        136

the worries of the world and enjoy the moment. Of course, Protagonists aren’t in

danger of losing their conscience, but a bit of fun can be a welcome respite from the

sense of responsibility that usually drives them.


This could all sound awfully superficial, but these partners can teach each other to

truly enjoy life – and not because Explorers take Protagonists to hip new restaurants.

By teaching Protagonists to live in the moment, their Explorer partners remind them

of the fleeting nature of life and the necessity of appreciating the world as it is, even

as they work to improve it.


With Explorers’ support, Protagonists can step off the implacable treadmill of “I

haven’t done enough” that makes it so hard for them to rest and recharge. In turn,

Protagonists can open Explorers’ eyes to the joy of service and contribution. As

anyone who volunteers on a regular basis can attest, helping others is one of the

greatest happiness boosters on the planet. By expanding each other’s horizons in

this manner, this couple can enjoy both pleasure and purpose, delight and meaning.


            Unbalanced Protagonist–Explorer Relationships

                                  Stubbornness Ensues


As can happen to any couple over time, Protagonist–Explorer couples risk reverting

to their core preferences while disregarding the other person’s needs. Both types can

be stubbornly dedicated to their own perspective and may suffer disconnection if

they can’t learn to respect each other’s approaches to life. Protagonists may find

themselves pushing reluctant Explorer partners to examine themselves and discover

deep, meaningful change. This cerebral, future-oriented approach may leave

experience-oriented Explorer partners feeling disconnected or judged.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        137

Protagonists sometimes focus on the welfare and potential of other people in an all-

too-serious way, as if they’ve agreed to some grim mandate. When Explorers are out

with friends on the weekend, the last thing they want to discuss is the injustices

committed by some corporation or government. Protagonists’ inherent difficulty

detaching from this serious mindset, to just have fun when they’re “supposed to,”

can quickly try their Explorer partners’ patience. Meanwhile, Protagonists may find

themselves wondering just what kind of person can seemingly switch off the part of

them that cares when there are more important things in the world than cutting

loose.


                                      Me Versus We


Protagonists thrive on team effort, and they view themselves and their partners as a

dynamic duo. They enjoy collaborating, brainstorming, tackling problems, and

generally facing the world with their partner by their side. Explorers, on the other

hand – Introverted Explorers in particular – are all about being able to do their own

thing. Although they appreciate their partners, they make their decisions

independently and prefer not to answer to anyone but themselves.


Some Explorers may go so far as to come home with a car they hadn’t consulted their

partner on, but this dynamic can manifest itself in less dramatic ways as well.

Protagonists may feel hurt, for example, if their partner faces a major hurdle at work

and doesn’t ask for their support – or even mention in to them. Protagonists want to

help, and when their Explorer partner doesn’t want that help, it can feel like a

personal affront. It doesn’t help if Protagonists offer unsolicited assistance, either, as

Explorers may feel smothered, second-guessed, or castigated.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         138
                                                                Romantic Relationships


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Explorer Relationships

                                   Good Complaining


When Protagonists judge their Explorer partners as shallow or self-interested, they

invoke one of the “four horsemen of the apocalypse” identified by relationships

researcher John Gottman. Specifically, they criticize, which is among the most toxic

communication styles in a romantic relationship. Paradoxically, if Explorers resist or

ignore such judgment, Protagonists might feel more inclined to criticize their

partners with greater frequency or force – and more damaging effects. They pave the

way for Explorers to react defensively and volley their own recriminations, which can

hit sensitive Protagonists hard.


Fortunately, this doesn’t mean the relationship is doomed. According to Gottman,

the antidote to criticism is to complain without blame. For example, “You never want

to talk about anything deep or meaningful,” might become, “I love to share my ideas

with you because you mean so much to me. Up for talking through a big idea?” This

way, the partners can still express their feelings and their frustrations without

wounding each other. The other benefit of this type of communication is that it opens

the door for hands-on fixes, which Explorers happily identify and implement.


Steps toward this goal:

   •   Consider whether the complaint is necessary. Some things simply don’t need

       to be said. When in doubt, wait for one minute before speaking. (Note that this

       is different from repression. If the frustration grows rather than diminishes

       with time, it probably needs to be expressed.)




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      139
                                                                  Romantic Relationships


   •     When in doubt, use a casual, good-humored tone: “Hold up, we didn’t agree

         on that!” Explorers are more likely to be amused by being called out than

         offended, if it’s done in a friendly tone.

   •     Make a positive request; in other words, ask for something specific in positive

         terms. “Can we stop talking about the party?” might become, “Could we talk

         about what’s on my mind for a few minutes?”

   •     Bear in mind that Explorers crave doing, not talking. When appropriate, going

         on a hike or taking a scenic drive can offer a better backdrop for meaningful

         conversation than hanging around home.


As positive conversations start to outweigh criticisms, Protagonists can reacquaint

themselves with the strengths and gifts of their Explorer partners. Whatever their

challenges, the immediacy and tangibility of Protagonist–Explorer relationships

create deeply moving moments for these couples that can overcome challenges of

all scales.


                                     Together and Apart


Protagonists want to help, but if taken too far, this can turn into a desire to be

involved in every aspect of their partner’s life. They may want to go out together

whenever possible, even tagging along for errands. And they often look for

opportunities to offer advice and support – whether it’s wanted. When involvement

veers into over-involvement, Explorers may react by exerting their independence,

shutting their Protagonist partners out of important decisions and aspects of their

lives.


It’s impossible to control or change anyone. Although Protagonists absolutely have

the right to object if their partner doesn’t discuss major decisions, changes, or



                                “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     140
                                                                    Romantic Relationships


purchases, they can’t force Explorers to give up their individualistic streaks. Instead,

Protagonists can honestly assess their own behavior, looking for ways they may have

been over-involved or overbearing. They can then choose their battles, distinguishing

between what truly matters and what they can let go.


When they want to create more engagement between themselves and their partners,

Protagonists can use the following strategies:


   •   Engage in your partner’s interests in much the same way you’d like your

       partner to engage in yours. Chances are that this will entail asking questions,

       expressing curiosity, or (if applicable) asking to watch as they work. Chances

       are that it won’t entail unsolicited advice or assistance.

          o You can’t force an Explorer to express genuine interest about your

              passions, but you can model the type of engagement you’d like to

              receive.

   •   Look for opportunities to involve your Explorer partner in hands-on activities

       rather than passive ones. A pottery class or a climbing gym is probably a better

       destination than a poetry reading.

   •   Even when your Explorer partner expresses initial reluctance to participate in

       an activity, they may still have a good time once they’re during it. Using your

       Intuitive and Feeling traits, you can learn to distinguish between mild

       reluctance and true aversion. In the former case, continue to encourage your

       partner to participate; in the later, recognize that it’s time to back off.


If we could change our partners into whomever we wanted them to be, love would

lose its meaning. At times, Explorers’ individualism may clash with Protagonists’

desire to act as a team. By noticing their own behavior and knowing when to back off

(and when to forge onward), Protagonists can avoid being overbearing or pushy as


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         141

they invite their Explorer partners to spend more time – and emotional energy –

together.

                                      Loving Well


A consistent theme throughout Protagonists’ lives is thoughtful intention to foster

connection and progress – in themselves, in the world, and especially in their

relationships with others. When it comes to romantic love, these types are wise to

maintain their passion and their loyalty, but they should also look past their exacting

views to embrace the varied, grand possibilities that await. With understanding and

tolerance, love can be built and sustained beautifully between Protagonists and any

other type. There is no perfect match between types, only wonderfully satisfying

matches between people who feel drawn to each other and are willing to forgive

mistakes, learn, and grow together.


The information in this chapter can help Protagonists on their journey of

understanding, both of themselves and in their relationships. It’s not always easy to

get an accurate sense of just how differently other people think and feel, even for a

type as emotionally astute as Protagonists. Learning about other types’ needs helps

Protagonists increase the objectivity of their own insights, enabling even deeper

connections with those who occupy a special place in their hearts.


                              Moving Forward Together


To Protagonists, the best romantic relationships aren’t passive. Shared laughs and

pleasure are only part of a fulfilling relationship, particularly in the long term.

Protagonists want conscious, progressive action with their partners.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       142

When lovers happily occupy large portions of each other’s lives, the less glamorous

or pleasant aspects of their lives also become intertwined. Everyone has flaws and

baggage, and expecting each other to handle such things alone or out of sight doesn’t

create the kind of interconnected relationships that Protagonists crave. Rebalancing

is all about facing each other’s issues with patience, love, and forgiveness, as well as

taking deliberate steps together in the real world to work things out.


Protagonists love to think, dream, and understand things in their heads, but thought

is only the first stage of progress – in life and in love. Finding practical ways to

cooperate and compromise with romantic partners is key to moving forward

together. This applies equally to achieving hopes and dreams and to maintaining

personal freedom and individuality.


The rebalancing sections above give just some ideas on how Protagonists and their

partners can respect each other while getting what they need to be happy. Although

it’s unrealistic to believe that any relationship will be all sunshine, it’s fully possible to

master difficult times together and walk out the other side smiling, hand in hand.

Protagonists can create this happy path for themselves with those they love.

                                Ethical and Inspirational


Protagonist parents strive to impress on their children the importance of an ethical

approach to the world’s problems, yet there’s a hopefulness to their view of life that

ensures these lessons are often more uplifting than chiding. With these parents, fairy

tales are used for their intended purpose – to offer lessons to their children on how

to fight for what is right and stand up to injustice. As an aspirational type, they expect

their children not to be perfect, but to always be on a journey to becoming something

better, for themselves and all people.


At their best, Protagonist parents are warm, loving, firm, and unwavering, a

combination of traits that provides their kids with the freedom and support to pursue

their goals. These traits also steer them as far away as possible from the more

dangerous pitfalls of youth. Protagonist parents play active roles in their children’s

lives, guiding them with love and support, but also with a firm refusal to enable any

behavior they see as morally misguided or self-destructive.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         144
                                                                             Parenthood


                              Devoted and Open-Minded


Though Protagonists can stretch themselves thin by taking on all the world’s

problems at once, their attention is seldom so divided that they can’t lavish a

generous portion on those closest to them. Nothing inspires these types like a great

cause, and shepherding their offspring can be their most important endeavor.

Protagonist parents who remember their children need space, as well as intimacy,

have little trouble maintaining strong bonds with their progeny for years.


Although parents with this personality type feel that no effort should be spared to

ensure their children’s health and well-being, they don’t hesitate to voice their

concerns in a respectful, age-appropriate way. They’ll push their children to be moral,

compassionate, and considerate of others, while also holding them accountable for

their choices and behavior. Protagonists have high expectations for their kids that

they don’t hesitate to make known; however, they welcome discussion with their

children over moral disagreements. When they’re confident in their values and

beliefs, Protagonist parents can support their children throughout their lives as they

develop their own identities and beliefs.


                               Unrealistic Expectations


Despite their best intentions, all parents struggle with various aspects of parenting.

It’s inevitable that parents become overwhelmed and stressed at some point. Losing

their temper is familiar enough, but exceptionally frustrated Protagonist parents can

face a crisis. If their children commit an unexpected lapse in moral judgment (as is

bound to happen sometime), these parents may let their imaginations run wild,

reading sweeping moral failures in simple mistakes.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       145
                                                                            Parenthood


Protagonists’ high moral standards also mean that things other personality types

might shrug off can offend them deeply. Because they identify so strongly with the

beliefs they hold, few things hurt Protagonists more than seeing their children

challenge or even reject them. Protagonist parents may blame themselves for

instilling the wrong values in their children, and they may try to fix that through

emotionally manipulative behaviors.


                                     Pushy Parents


As open-minded as these types can be, if their passion for a specific belief gets out

of hand, they can become downright demanding. When they commit to a specific

ideology and expect their kids to follow, the scales can tip from inspiring to dogmatic.

Different methods work best, based on children’s needs: Parents who stubbornly

focus on one educational ideology risk doing more harm than good.


Forcing an uninterested preschooler to take Mandarin classes or insisting that their

introverted teenager join a club or sports team for more social interaction inevitably

breeds spite and bitterness. The intentions behind these efforts may be noble, but

when Protagonist parents fail to share their passions, they may end up with children

who automatically reject their ideas and beliefs.


                                 Practicing Forgiveness


Parents with this personality type may have a hard time aligning their expectations

with reality, especially when it comes to moral and ethical scenarios. When they feel

as though they’ve violated their moral code, perhaps by yelling at their toddlers or

giving their teenagers unreasonable punishments, Protagonist parents can be

exceptionally tough on themselves. They often find it difficult to forgive themselves

for failing to uphold their high standards.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        146

There’s nothing wrong with high personal expectations, but an inability to forgive

themselves – or others – for failures can ultimately result in bitter, unhappy parents.

Parenting is hard, and all parents, no matter how noble and moral, make mistakes –

a lot of mistakes. The key to happy, balanced parenting is finding ways to forgive

mistakes and look, instead, for signs of growth and improvement. Focusing on what

they’ve done right – like figuring out effective ways to calm their toddlers’ tantrums –

instead of their mistakes can lead to more contentment and fulfillment in their

relationships with both themselves and their children.


                                Inspiring Independence


As much as they may believe they’re encouraging their children by helping them

solve all their problems, Protagonist parents who don’t allow their kids to struggle

and learn from their mistakes are doing them a disservice. Fortunately, they can

easily transform that same passion they have for encouraging their children into a

passion for promoting their growth and development. Many Protagonists consider

themselves aficionados in personal development, as they seek and engage in growth

opportunities themselves. Their drive to constantly improve and evolve is

inspirational and can help them serve as mentors to their children.


The key to inspiring healthy independence is to provide the proper balance of

challenge and support to children throughout their lives. Kids shouldn’t wallow in

confusion, but parents shouldn’t be too quick to jump in and solve their problems,

either. Allowing children to experience failure is just as important as supporting them

during their greatest trials. Kids who “forget” to study for their history test must

accept the consequences of their behavior (i.e., not paying attention, being

disorganized). Instead of swooping in to “save” them, Protagonist parents should

help them cope with these consequences and learn from them.

    Parenting for Each Stage of Development
Each stage of children’s growth presents both unique challenges and exciting

milestones. Learning how to navigate these stages can seem daunting, but the

opportunity to build healthy attachments and create meaningful memories makes it

worth the struggle.


Renowned psychologist Erik Erikson proposed a theory of psychosocial development

that identified eight stages, five of which take place between birth and 18 years of

age. It’s important to remember that these stages aren’t set in stone, and the ages

listed for each stage are approximate. Children develop at their own pace and meet

each milestone in their own time, often even skipping stages, achieving them in an

unexpected order or trying one milestone out and falling back to an old one – this is

especially common with learning to walk. This is often normal, but it’s worth

developing a relationship with a pediatric physician to check in with any questions

and concerns.


The following paragraphs discuss what to expect at each stage of development, as

well as how the strengths and weaknesses of the Protagonist personality type affect

their parenting at each stage.



Building Bonds (from Birth to Approximately 1½ Years)

According to Erikson, the stages of infancy and early childhood last from birth until

approximately three years of age. Children in these stages are very dependent on

their parents to meet their needs. This is also when the bonds of attachment are

created as parents meet children’s needs, develop trusting relationships, and

promote autonomy.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                     148

The main priority for infants on the journey to attachment is having their basic needs

met. From being fed to receiving affection, infants either learn to trust that their

Protagonist parents provide for them or suffer from a sense of mistrust in all their

subsequent relationships. If parents are inconsistent or neglectful in providing for

their children, their infants have difficulty creating a positive, trusting attachment

with them.


On the other hand, attentive and affectionate parents, especially those who engage

in consistent physical contact – such as snuggling or transporting their children in

baby carriers on their bodies – encourage trusting, hopeful relationships with their

infants and are likely to have minimal difficulty building comfortable attachments.


                            Balanced Infant Bonding

                                 Building Loving Bonds


Few things in life are as exciting as bringing home a new baby, and Protagonists, with

their desire to connect with others, find this stage particularly satisfying. Protagonists

who tap into their empathy and sensitivity when their children are born have no

trouble giving their infants the attention and affection needed to build loving bonds.

Infants need affection that goes beyond just daily care. They crave the physical

connection their parents provide through cuddling, rocking, speaking softly, and

making eye contact. Parents’ loving smiles do more than just entertain their infants;

they create a primal connection that inspires the trust they need to develop positive

relationships.


As parents, Protagonists thrive on feeling needed and enjoy being their children’s

primary caretakers. This is vital, as it can motivate them during the extraordinarily

draining infant stage. Some parents may struggle with maintaining energy during this


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         149
                                                                              Parenthood


phase, thus creating mood swings or other inconsistent behaviors, but Protagonists’

seemingly ceaseless energy and their reliability allow them to not only survive this

stage but even relish it.


                                  Motivated Caretakers


Loving bonds, as discussed previously, are important. Even more so, motivated

Protagonists truly excel at being eager to alter their lives to meet their infants’ needs.

The moment their children are born, the first time they smile, and when they say

“momma” or “dada” – these are all meaningful, motivating experiences. Protagonist

parents live for these simple moments, from cuddling with their sleepy, satiated

babies in their rocking chairs to making silly faces at them while changing their

diapers. Few parents are as attuned to, and appreciative of, the meaningful moments

that build loving bonds with their children as Protagonists are.


One of the greatest Protagonist strengths is their selfless concern for others. Caring

for infants, who are utterly reliant on others to meet their needs, may drain parents

of other personality types. Protagonist parents, however, truly thrive on what most

would consider an exhausting mission, where they’re required to put their personal

needs on hold to care for a completely dependent child. Protagonists view building

empathic, emotional bonds with their children as their number one priority

throughout the lifespan. The infancy stage, for these parents, is one of the most

rewarding times to interact and bond with their children.

                          Unbalanced Infant Bonding

                                  Taking on Too Much


Many new parents experience a great deal of pressure to maintain their pre-infant

lifestyles after their children are born. When Protagonist parents become too

focused on living up to unrealistic expectations placed by either themselves or

others, they may find themselves taking on more than they can handle. People with

this personality type often manage a full plate of obligations even before they have

children, and both new parents and veterans alike may attempt to play the role of

“super parents” by jumping back into work right away or obsessing about keeping up

with a busy social calendar. When Protagonists insist on returning to their pre-

parenthood (or pre–new child) grind before they’re ready, they end up overtaxing

themselves physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally.


To further complicate matters, Protagonists, with their innate leadership abilities,

often feel it’s their role to help others. Asking for help, even when they truly need it,

can be extraordinarily difficult for those who identify as the “helper.” The infant and

toddler years are some of the most challenging that parents face, and an

unwillingness to seek or accept help from others dramatically increases the

possibility that Protagonist parents will experience frustration, exhaustion, and even

an uncharacteristic lack of motivation.


                              Struggling with Expectations


In addition to struggling with taking on too much, Protagonists may have unrealistic

expectations of what they can teach their children at this stage. They may believe

that their infants should be able to achieve certain milestones more quickly than is

necessary or fret that their children aren’t hitting milestones “on time.” Anxious


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        151

Protagonist parents may be more concerned about teaching their children to sit up,

roll over, feed themselves, or walk before they’re truly ready, rather than

appreciating their children’s current abilities and engaging with them at their level.


It’s certainly exciting to see their babies roll over for the first time or sit up on their

own, but pushing children to achieve these milestones causes frustration for both

parties involved. Just because their brilliant infants aren’t saying their first words at

the same time as their friends’ children doesn’t mean that they aren’t on track

developmentally. Development isn’t a measure of parental ability, and both

Protagonist parents and their infants end up much happier and more relaxed if

they’re allowed to mature at their own pace.


                          Rebalancing Infant Bonding

                                     Seeking Support


Learning to balance their needs with their children’s needs is one of the most

important things Protagonists can do. To do this, they need to take time to

understand and accept their own limits. It’s not unreasonable for new parents to

request the maximum time off after the birth of a child, or to let people know they’ll

just be stopping by this year’s fundraiser rather than organizing it. Being healthy

parents is more important than being “super parents,” and it is much more realistic

as well.


Although Protagonists tend to feel guilty (and even self-indulgent) when they put

their needs ahead of the needs of others, they will find that doing so makes them

happier, healthier parents. There are many ways to take quality time, but not

everyone has the time (or resources) to take a weekend retreat, get weekly massages,

or even take a daily 15-minute nap. The following suggestions can be effective ways

for busy, burned-out Protagonist parents to recharge in just a few minutes:


   •   Enjoy a 30-minute bath while a partner or friend puts the kids to bed.

   •   Take a relative up on their offer to babysit.

   •   Meet with friends for coffee at home or a coffee shop once a week.

   •   Engage in a deep breathing exercise or yoga stretches for five minutes.

   •   Join a club or group such as a book club, sports team, parent support group,

       or any other “adults-only” activity that allows for time to interact with others

       without being distracted by children (even if it’s only for a brief amount of

       time).

   •   Regularly share thoughts or feelings with a friend or partner.


                                 Prioritizing Attachment


Protagonists prepare themselves to be extraordinary teachers, but when it comes to

promoting their infants’ development, they may be more pushy than helpful.

Offering their children unconditional love and support, especially at such a young

age, is much more important than cultivating genius. When they’re intent on seeing

their infants “make progress” in their growth and development, even the most well-

meaning Protagonist parents may sacrifice some of the beauty of a loving parent-

child bond.


The most important development that needs to take place during this stage is a

loving attachment between parent and child. Such a bond can create the foundation

for the rest of the child’s development. Learning to crawl is important, but having

parents who love and support them unconditionally, regardless of their abilities, is




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      153
                                                                              Parenthood


much more important. The following activities can help Protagonist parents bond

with and appreciate their infants right now:


    •   Read out loud. Children’s stories are ideal but not necessary, as small babies

        gain a lot just by hearing their parents speak.

    •   Practice baby wearing. Parents can do many chores and activities (like

        sweeping or shopping) while babies are in wearable carriers. This contact

        promotes bonding and helps even the fussiest babies fall asleep – bonus!

    •   Engage in skin-to-skin contact as often as possible, especially with young

        infants.

    •   Write down infants’ milestones (first smile, first tooth, and so on) to keep track

        of their progress.



     Testing Boundaries (from Approximately 1½ to 3
                                        Years)

Once they’re mobile, young children become very interested in exploring their

environment with their senses. Crawling, walking, grabbing items, putting things in

their mouths, and communicating verbally are just a few of the ways that toddlers

learn about the world around them.


During this stage, Protagonist parents must provide a safe harbor for their children

while still allowing them to experience and explore their surroundings. Children who

can test boundaries yet still receive parental support and encouragement develop a

sense of autonomy. Toddlers who are overly restricted, criticized, or made to feel

guilty for testing boundaries ultimately experience shame and may suffer from

feelings of incompetence or low self-worth. These feelings can last throughout their

                                                                          Parenthood


lives, perhaps jeopardizing their ability to achieve goals and develop positive

character traits such as reliability or confidence.


                          Balanced Toddler Bonding

                              Compassionate and Engaged


Extremely supportive, Protagonists make an ideal “home base” for their children

during this stage. Their focus on meaningful engagement with their children,

combined with a sincere determination to meet their needs, ensures that their

toddlers never feel abandoned, ignored, or unloved. Even though children at this age

are incredibly independent, they still crave (and need) trustworthy caregivers, and

Protagonists don’t disappoint.


Protagonists’ compassion is especially useful during the trying toddler years. This

stage can certainly be challenging, but confident parents with this personality type

enjoy promoting their children’s curiosity and independence while still maintaining a

safe environment. They take pleasure in helping their children learn how to pick out

their own clothes and dress themselves while also promoting their toddlers’ natural

creativity and self-expression. Helping their kids learn to become creative, self-

reliant, and competent are among Protagonist parents’ greatest joys.


                            Nurturing Creative Connections


As far as parent-child activities are concerned, these parents prioritize open-minded,

active engagement as a means of emotional bonding. People with this personality

type enjoy things that excite their visionary spirit, and they rarely have difficulty

coming up with thoughtful, unique ideas. Providing opportunities for their children

to learn and experience new and different things is especially important to

Protagonist parents, who thrive on pursuing such opportunities for themselves as

well.


The toddler stage is devoted to exploration of all kinds, from trying different foods

to discovering new places. These parents are more than happy to provide

opportunities for their children to experience the world around them. Many

Protagonists love nature and believe in respect for all living things. They encourage

their toddlers to experience and enjoy nature as well, whether it means taking day

trips or weekend outings to parks and reserves or stopping to take a closer look at

flowers, birds, and insects. These activities offer parents an excellent opportunity to

teach their children the importance of empathy, kindness, and the world around

them.


                        Unbalanced Toddler Bonding

                                Difficulty with Defiance


If they take their toddlers’ willful or defiant behavior personally, Protagonist parents

will find this stage especially challenging. It can be both frustrating and discouraging

when their lovingly raised children begin using their newly acquired favorite word,

“No!” in response to their questions. From throwing a fit every evening at bedtime to

refusing to eat any form of fresh produce (or any healthy food for that matter),

toddlers often seem intent on challenging their parents at every turn. As much as

they want to foster their children’s independence, Protagonists who believe “the

parent always knows what’s best” undoubtedly struggle when their children ignore

their wisdom.


The toddler stage is when identity development begins, so children don’t always

behave in ways that fit their parents’ molds. Behaviors such as hitting their siblings


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        156
                                                                             Parenthood


or yelling at their parents – which are, although not desirable, normal for this stage –

can be especially demoralizing for Protagonists who feel that their children’s moral

development should be further along at this point. When these parents are more

focused on idealized versions of their children, they may miss opportunities to

support what’s unique about their toddlers.


                                     Overly Involved


Protagonist parents may believe they’re supportive, engaging parents, but a

misguided tendency to provide too many structured activities can stunt their

toddlers’ development. Structured or educational games may seem to promote

learning when, in reality, children need to learn how to generate their own ideas and

solve real-world problems.


Similarly, if Protagonists step in every time their child argues with another, it impedes

social development by preventing the child from learning on their own to resolve

conflict. Constant interventions at the toddler stage can result in children who expect

that every issue will be solved for them, which can result in a failure to take

responsibility for their own behavior. Despite their best intentions, overly involved

Protagonists run the risk of limiting their toddlers’ ability to deal with the challenges

they face as they grow older.

                             Modeling Respectful Behavior


As much as Protagonists love to promote their children’s growth, it can be

disheartening to watch their formerly cuddly and relatively docile infants transform

into defiant, raging “No” machines. Although they may wonder what happened to



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        157

their sweet babies, Protagonist parents can take heart: The toddler stage is just that,

a stage. Wild mood swings and forceful gestures of independence – like screaming

and running through the grocery store when they don’t get the cereal they want –

should balance out once they’re school-aged.


It’s especially important for Protagonist parents to understand that their children are

establishing their autonomy. Children this age aren’t intentionally rejecting their

parents: Much like college students who party when they’re supposed to be studying,

toddlers are pushing boundaries as part of finding their own way. Just because

children are becoming more independent, however, doesn’t mean that parents

should allow them to get away with demanding behavior. Protagonist parents still

need to redirect their children and model the appropriate ways to behave. Some

ways to do this:


   •   Teach toddlers to raise their hands or place their hands on a parent’s arm if

       they need to speak instead of interrupting – their parents will know they have

       something to say and still get to finish their sentences.

   •   Use techniques such as laughing or clapping loudly rather than shouting, “No!”

       when children are engaging in undesirable behaviors.

   •   Practice labeling emotions using pictures (smiley face, sad face, angry face)

       and have toddlers point to the faces that match their emotions. This should

       eventually help them feel understood rather than feeling as though they must

       act on their emotions.

   •   Read stories where problems are solved with good behavior and emotional

       control, such as Little Blue Truck, Where the Wild Things Are, and The Runaway

       Bunny.

                           Focusing on Appropriate Growth


Doing too much for their children can be just as damaging as inconsistent discipline,

but with some of their own personal discipline and development, Protagonist

parents can prevent or undo any negative consequences of their constant

interventions. The most effective way to do this is to tap into their natural desire to

encourage their children and their ability to persuade others.


Protagonist parents can encourage their toddlers’ development by regularly looking

for opportunities to promote growth, problem-solving skills, and autonomy. Their

focus should be on fostering age-appropriate development and encouraging kids to

practice certain skills, including gross motor skills (such as walking, jumping, and

running) and fine motor skills (such as stacking blocks and putting together simple

puzzles). The following actions can allow Protagonists to support their children while

also inspiring independence:


   •   Give toddlers a few clothing options (two or three) to pick out when they get

       dressed, have them try pouring their own cereal, and encourage them to wash

       their own hands and face after mealtime.

   •   Make time for play and allow the children to lead the way with participatory

       imaginative play.

   •   Encourage them to resolve conflicts through sharing and using kind words –

       and resist the temptation to solve the issue for them.

    Thirst for Knowledge (from Approximately 3 to 5
                                       Years)

The preschool years, from approximately three to five years of age, are a prime time

for brain development, and children at this stage accumulate knowledge at an

extraordinary rate. Preschoolers absorb information constantly, through restless

activity and a seemingly unending stream of questions. Learning at this stage takes

place through play, especially the unstructured and imaginary kind, and through

social interaction with family and peers. They also exercise creativity through make-

believe games and stories.


If children don’t have the opportunity to set the agenda occasionally, or if their

constant questions or childish make-believe games are received with annoyance,

kids can experience feelings of guilt, frustration, and incompetence. Consequently,

they may suffer from poor self-control or a lack of initiative. Parents who wish to

navigate this stage successfully must give their children the opportunity to make

some of their own decisions, initiate activities, ask questions, receive answers, and

lead others in exploratory play.


                     Balanced Preschool Relationships

                                   Excellent Teachers


As proponents of lifelong learning, Protagonist parents genuinely want to inspire

their children to enjoy learning. People with this personality type happily answer their

preschool children’s stream of questions and take great pleasure in creatively

engaging them in learning opportunities. From trips to the library to impromptu




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        160

nature “classes” while walking to the park, Protagonists take any chance they can to

engage and educate their preschoolers.


Seeking out educational opportunities isn’t the only form of teaching that these

parents engage in – modeling morals and values for their children from a young age

is as important to them as other forms of learning. Protagonist parents teach their

preschoolers to respect others and appreciate their differences. They insist on

integrity: If their children dig up a neighbor’s flowers, these parents would encourage

their little ones to apologize to neighbor, then help them understand why digging up

those flowers was wrong. Protagonists feel it’s their moral obligation to instill these

important values through modeling and consistent encouragement.


                                Emotionally Intelligent


Emotional engagement is a high priority – both in terms of building strong bonds

with their children and teaching them how to develop their emotional intelligence.

Kids at this stage are learning the importance of self-control, empathy, and

interpersonal relationships (especially with peers) and need guidance to properly

develop these skills.


Children best learn emotional intelligence through modeling, and this is where

Protagonist parents can truly shine. Those who have developed their own self-

control and can engage in genuine, thoughtful ways can lovingly communicate these

concepts to their children. Imaginary play is an especially useful outlet for practicing

these skills. Something as simple as playing a game of “house” with their children can

be a perfect opportunity for these parents to both model healthy relationships and

lovingly correct inappropriate behavior. Parents who engage in this type of play with

their preschoolers pass along wisdom and enhance their emotional bonds as well.

                   Unbalanced Preschool Relationships

                                 Exceedingly Ambitious


Protagonists rarely struggle to maintain the energy necessary to keep up with their

children. However, they tend to overestimate how much they themselves and their

preschoolers can accomplish in a single day. Busyness may energize these parents,

but their young children may not benefit from a packed schedule of playdates, art

classes, and errands with little time for rest or free play. This incessant action and

limited opportunities to exercise their free will plant the seeds of future resentfulness

and rebellion.


There’s also a danger that Protagonist parents who fall into the “overachiever” trap

can become overworked and overwhelmed during this stage. Just keeping up with

housework, a career, and the myriad needs of an entire household can exhaust

anyone. Life at this stage becomes even more challenging when parents must now

also run their children from preschool to playdates to swimming lessons and karate

class. Parents in today’s digital society can also feel burdened by the need to make

every birthday party and family vacation worthy of posting on social media.

Attempting to achieve “perfect parent” status can quickly take a toll on Protagonists,

who would prefer to focus on more meaningful aspects of life.


                                Overestimating Abilities


During the preschool years, children are transitioning from completely dependent

infants to increasingly independent individuals. As their little ones grow more

competent and communicative, these parents risk overestimating their preschoolers’

capabilities. Their desire to one day view their kids as equals can result in early

unrealistic expectations that frustrate both parents and children.


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        162

Protagonists, as morally focused individuals, may assume that their preschoolers can

easily grasp any ideas or moral constructs. This is especially true when the

information they provide is hypothetical. Saying, “You shouldn’t hit people. How

would you feel if someone hit you?” seems like a perfectly reasonable question.

However, children at this stage are incapable of putting themselves in other people’s

shoes. They may respond, “I would feel bad,” but what they’re really thinking is, “I

would feel bad if someone hit me, but what I really feel bad about right now is getting

in trouble.” Empathy and moral reasoning are still undeveloped at this stage, and

Protagonist parents who expect their children to be proficient in these skills struggle

to communicate effectively (and appropriately) with their preschoolers.


                   Rebalancing Preschool Relationships

                                 Adjusting Expectations


Rather than letting their ambition drive both themselves and their children to the

brink of burnout, Protagonist parents must learn to say, “No,” to endless playdates

and nature classes, and say, “Yes,” to a much-needed break when necessary. Children

benefit more from getting rest and having freedom than from attending every class,

sport, and extracurricular activity possible. Unstructured playtime provides

preschoolers with a creative outlet and encourages self-initiation – both necessities

for successfully navigating this stage.


Although Protagonist parents may initially feel some guilt for not meeting societal

expectations – or their own overly ambitious ones – they ultimately feel will liberated

from unnecessary obligations. Their natural tendency is to live life based on their

values, not social dictates, and they must find their way back to those values as they

raise their children. It’s also important for people with this personality type to find



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      163

ways to take care of themselves while parenting their preschoolers. Here are some

ideas that can help bring balance to this busy stage:


    •     Limit activities such as playdates, sports, art classes, etc., to just a couple of

          times per week rather than every other day.

    •     Resist the temptation to make sure that every event or activity is social media

          worthy.

    •     Schedule regular breaks such as parent date nights, drinks with friends, or solo

          walks in nature – anything that’s recharging and refreshing.

    •     Spend quality time with preschoolers with no agenda or expectations.


Protagonist parents who provide a primarily peaceful, relaxed environment will

experience happier, healthier relationships with their children.


                              Accepting Age-Appropriate Abilities


The preschool stage is one of the most delightful, as children at this age can

communicate with and understand their parents far more effectively than they could

in earlier years. Parents who can focus on the progress that children have made are

more successful in their interactions than those who dwell on their undeveloped

skills.


From silly jokes to profound questions, preschoolers often display a type of genius

that’s truly inspiring. Additionally, their authenticity is unparalleled at this stage,

making them capable of sincere, compassionate interactions with others. Despite

their undeveloped moral reasoning and empathy, preschoolers are capable of

affection and kindness, traits that endear them to even the most frustrated or

flabbergasted parents. Protagonists who recognize their preschoolers’ strengths find

it easier to remain optimistic when they’re faced with their shortcomings. The

following brief exercise can help Protagonist parents appreciate their children exactly

as they are:


   •   Sit down at a table with your preschooler, a box of crayons, and several blank

       pieces of paper.

   •   Have the child tell stories and illustrate them by drawing pictures (help by

       drawing and writing the stories down).

   •   Collect the drawings and make them into a book by binding them with staples

       or string.

   •   Sit back and admire the genius and creativity that your preschooler is capable

       of.



   Creating Competence (from Approximately 5 to 12
                                        Years)

The early school years are an important period of skill development for young

children. They’re still constantly absorbing new information, and they’re also

developing proficiency in increasingly complex areas, from relationships to

mathematics to athletics. Children who are challenged and supported in these areas

flourish in both their abilities and self-confidence.


If they don’t receive consistent support, kids at this stage can begin to feel inferior to

their peers, and they will be less likely to develop or work toward long-term goals.

On the other hand, if they aren’t sufficiently challenged, they can begin to feel overly

confident in themselves and their abilities, and they may come to lack modesty and

compassion toward others.

                    Balanced School-Age Relationships

                             Passionate and Encouraging


Protagonists are disproportionately drawn to working in education, and they are

ardent supporters of lifelong learning. However, passing spelling tests and

memorizing multiplication tables aren’t as important to Protagonists as having

children who are creative and compassionate in their success. If they feel their kids

aren’t receiving a truly holistic education, Protagonist parents can explore alternative

options such as tutoring, charter schools, or even homeschooling to fill in the gaps.


Ever the compassionate parents, these types provide both support and

encouragement to children who are struggling. They’re careful to ensure that their

high expectations don’t prevent them from being understanding and empathetic.

Children are expected to put effort into gaining knowledge and developing their

skills, but Protagonist parents won’t hesitate to come to the aid of those who are

struggling with a certain class or the school bully. At the same time, they encourage

their children to work toward finding solutions to problems themselves, which helps

children achieve a sense of balanced competence that’s necessary at this stage of

development.


                                   Excellent Mentors


The school years are a time of intense learning, and Protagonists are natural mentors

who can model the skills needed for success in academics. These parents eagerly

teach their children the value of hard work and stress the importance of traits such

as innovation and creativity. Few types understand the necessity of these traits the

way Protagonists do.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        166

At a stage in life when kids are constantly being told what to do and conforming to

strict schedules, innovation and creativity often become neglected or viewed as

unnecessary. Imaginative Protagonist parents understand the importance of these

traits in an ever-changing world and encourage their children to incorporate their

unique ideas and perspectives into both their academic and personal lives. They may

also encourage their children to explore the arts – visual, performing, or literary –

whether attending a performance of The Nutcracker together or enrolling their would-

be ballerinas in dancing lessons. For Protagonist parents, creative expression is much

more vital than financial success or the status of a profession or title.


                   Unbalanced School-Age Relationships

                               Passionately Out of Touch


Protagonists’ passion for a cause can create issues for their children at this stage if it

isn’t properly balanced with their children’s needs and abilities. School-aged children

certainly benefit from volunteering and standing up for their beliefs. However, they

also need parents who can help them address the issues they face in day-to-day life.

From a school crush that isn’t reciprocated to the trauma of being picked last for the

kickball team, children at this age need parents who can help them deal with

personal issues that deeply affect them.


Always focused on saving the world, Protagonist parents may fail to validate their

children’s feelings on these “smaller issues,” perhaps finding that their kids are less

likely to seek their help or support in the future. Sure, the world isn’t going to end if

their sons or daughters don’t make the basketball team, but it can feel catastrophic.

To children at this age, everything that happens to them is a big deal. Protagonist

parents who don’t help their children deal with their issues in balanced and effective

ways often struggle to maintain close relationships.


                                Pretentiously Idealistic


Although they may not concern themselves with typical achievements and awards,

Protagonists can be rather demanding parents when it comes to measuring up to

their ideals. When their expectations are more idealistic than realistic, they may

become paranoid that their children won’t live up to the values and principles they’ve

outlined. Having their children turn out to be cynical, irresponsible, or apathetic is

among Protagonist parents’ greatest fears.


One of the greatest demands these parents make stems from a fear of something

less sinister, however – being ordinary. They set ambitious life targets for themselves

and stand up against evil in the name of high moral goals, through acts big and small.

They may never be able to declare victory, but they know in their hearts that they

fight the good fight. They expect the same of their children – with freedom, strength

of will, and dreams, their children could change the world!


But their kids may want a simple, stable life. Rather than declaring war on the

injustice in the world, they may just want happy lives being moderately popular and

maintaining decent grades. Overly idealistic Protagonists can struggle to understand

that this is as valid and desirable as any other path because it’s what their children

feel is right for them.

                  Rebalancing School-Age Relationships

                            Meeting Them Where They Are


Well-meaning Protagonists place high expectations on their children, hoping that it

encourages them to make a difference in the world. Unfortunately, when the focus

is constantly on what is expected – especially when the expectations are

extraordinary – these parents are apt to miss out on what their children really need.

What kids need most from their parents is unconditional love and acceptance,

combined with mutual goals and reasonable boundaries, and Protagonist parents

are more than capable of providing them.


Those who are prone to fixating on the “big picture” can benefit from focusing on

what their children are dealing with now – this the big picture, for them. Rather than

trying to hammer a square peg (Protagonist parents’ idea of what is important) into

a round hole (what their children think is important), these parents should make a

point to engage with their children in the “here and now.” Some ideas that can help:


   •   Start a gratitude practice where both parents and children state three things

       they’re grateful for that day and one thing that’s bothering them.

   •   Incorporate a mindfulness practice into your routine, perhaps with the

       gratitude practice, where parents and children spend five minutes focusing on

       deep, focused breathing.

   •   Set aside time weekly where parents and children can engage in activities

       together, such as hitting up an arcade, taking a hike, or checking out a

       museum.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      169
                                                                              Parenthood


Children face significant challenges as they navigate this stage, and support from

their parents is necessary for them to not only achieve competence but also learn

how to interact with others in a compassionate and understanding way.


                           Embracing Individual Perspectives


As much as Protagonist parents may want their children to focus on vanquishing all

the evils of the world, it’s more important that they focus on promoting their overall

well-being. They’re very devoted to their values, especially reliability, integrity, and

social justice, as well as their children. Using their devotion, Protagonists can create

definitions of personal success that embrace the individual perspectives their

children possess.


Protagonists should encourage their children to develop their own values and pursue

their own definitions of a successful life, which can undoubtedly go through multiple

iterations as they grow, learn, and evolve. This can be done by looking at the

institutions that have played an important part in their lives, such as their faith, their

family, or clubs in which they’re involved. Although Protagonists’ values may be

noble, their children’s confidence and sense of identity depend on their abilities to

determine their own values without judgment, even if their idea of a meaningful life

doesn’t match that of their parents. The following exercise can help Protagonist

parents practice accepting and encouraging their children’s dreams and ideas while

withholding their tendency to judge them:


      •   Write down one important value. Include at least two reasons why it’s

          important.

      •   Imagine a friend or loved one criticizing that value, and write down the

          feelings that would trigger.

       •   Use this information to consider how judgmental behavior toward the

           values of others, especially children, can make them feel.



      Find Thyself (from Approximately 12 to 18 Years)

Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood, when children focus on

developing their own distinct identities. This transitional period centers around their

individual sense of what their roles are in their relationships with themselves, others,

and society in general. To determine their roles, adolescents at this stage begin the

all-important process of identifying their personal values and beliefs. They make

educational and future career goals and develop relationships based on how they

align with their values and beliefs, making this a pivotal, foundational stage for the

rest of their lives.


                       Balanced Adolescent Relationships

                               Promoting Positive Values


During this stage of identity development, older children need the support and

understanding of their parents more than ever. Protagonist parents encourage their

adolescents’ growth by promoting positive values, such as respect, compassion, and

integrity, while also providing them with freedom to explore other values that inspire

them. Mature Protagonists understand the importance of allowing their teens to go

through the difficult yet necessary process of personal development with the proper

balance of support and stepping back.


Regardless of the struggles Protagonists may face during this tumultuous time, they

remain steadfast in their devotion to their children. Their dedication, both to their

kids and to the promotion of positive values, provides a solid foundation that allows

                                                                           Parenthood


identity-seeking children to venture further into self-discovery while still feeling a

sense of support and love.


                         Unconditional Love and Commitment


People often make personal identity discoveries through trial and error, which often

translates into mistakes. Protagonist parents’ unconditional love and support are

indispensable as they help their teens cope with the many challenges they face. An

adolescent who skips class needs to know that there are consequences to their

behavior but also that their parents still love them regardless of their mistakes.

Children at this stage are more likely to communicate with their parents if they’re

confident that they won’t be judged and aren’t at risk of having their parents’ love

and acceptance revoked.


This is especially true when they’re dealing with something truly serious: a pregnancy,

suspension or expulsion, or even painful milestones like a rough breakup.

Protagonist parents who stay loving toward their children during these dilemmas can

establish themselves as true sources of empathy and wisdom when their children

need it most. As overwhelming and terrifying as some of these situations are,

Protagonists who can tap into their compassion and forward-thinking natures can

confront these situations from places of wisdom rather than of panic. Beyond

treating their adolescents with respect, Protagonists can strive to be the wise,

understanding adults in the room.

                                                                            Parenthood


                  Unbalanced Adolescent Relationships

                                    Imposing Ideals


Like the issues they faced during their children’s school-aged years, Protagonists who

have unrealistic expectations of their adolescents’ identity development struggle

with their ever-expanding independence. People with this personality type are very

accepting of the pursuit of personal development, but they may have their own ideas

about what this process should look like and what values their children should

espouse. Protagonists with passionate political or religious views may find their

children’s desire to explore seemingly “oppositional” beliefs insulting, even worth

undoing based on principle alone.


Protagonist parents who believe that personal development can be accomplished

only within specific, approved parameters – regardless of where those boundaries

fall on any scale – may inadvertently prevent their adolescents from going through

the self-discovery process. Adolescents are unlikely to respond well to this type of

parental control and may act out in rebellious ways or shut down and stop

communicating with their parents altogether.


                                    Overly Sensitive


Because of their sensitivity and focus on morality, Protagonists are hurt deeply by

things other personality types might shrug off. Few things are more hurtful to them

than seeing their deeply held morals and beliefs flaunted, especially by their children.

When they’re feeling insecure about their parenting, they may blame themselves for

being unable to instill the right values in their children, and they may try to fix the

problem by resorting to increasingly intense moral and emotional appeals.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        173

Teenagers often rebel against their parents’ authority by actively exploring new and

often contrary ideas. But parents shouldn’t immediately assume that their teens are

sincerely opposed to their beliefs or that all their teachings have been ignored.

Whether such assumptions are grounded in truth or not, they can feel deeply hurt.

If they then focus on mitigating damage and strengthening their relationships in

cloying or manipulative ways, Protagonists may create even stronger pushback. If

they let their sensitivity get the best of them, they can forget that they, too, once

craved freedom and independence when they were teens, especially when it came

to the pursuit of ideas and ideals. Their children are likely to recognize and appreciate

this, which should help make adolescence less chaotic.


                  Rebalancing Adolescent Relationships

                              Celebrating Individual Ideals


Discovering ideals that are personally meaningful is one of the most important

aspects of identity development for Protagonists. Rather than being offended or

insulted if their children’s ideals don’t match their own, mature parents with this

personality type can celebrate the fact that their adolescents have gone through this

same process of self-discovery. If their children understand right and wrong and have

well-developed moral compasses, Protagonists can take a step back and appreciate

a parenting job well done.


The best way for parents to encourage their teens to develop their own personal

ideals is to encourage them to privately focus on embracing values that are

meaningful to their individual journeys. Although they can be encouraged to draw

from family values during this process, it’s important for Protagonist parents to avoid

pressuring or trying to “guilt” their adolescents into agreeing with their own values



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        174

and beliefs. The following exercise can help Protagonist parents guide their

teenagers through this process. Protagonists can have their teenagers answer the

following questions to get them started:


   •   Think about the times in your life when you have felt the happiest and most

       successful. What did they have in common?

   •   Keeping those moments in mind, use a list or a mind map and write down the

       words that remind you of those times. If getting a high school diploma was

       something that made you feel successful, writing the values, “love of learning”

       or “perseverance” would be appropriate.

   •   Choose five to 10 values from the list or mind map.

   •   Figure out a way to implement those values. Make sure to start with one at a

       time. If “love of learning” is one of your values, consider signing up for an

       online course, or try learning a new language.


                  Improving Understanding of Themselves and Others


One of the best ways to counter a tendency to be overly sensitive is for teens to

improve their understanding of themselves and others. If Protagonist parents are

unaware of their own triggers that make them feel insecure or offended, it’s easy for

them to get carried away with any perceived slights. Likewise, if they fail to

understand that their children have their own unique values and personality traits,

they may assume that they’re defiant or difficult. Despite the amount of influence

that these parents have over their teens, it’s important to both respect and support

their differences. They may not choose to be vegans like their parents, but that

doesn’t mean that they don’t value life or love the environment any less.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      175

Parenthood provides the opportunity for Protagonists to learn from their children

and grow as human beings. Sometimes parenting can bring out the worst – like

yelling at a teenager who has failed to clean up their room again – but it also brings

out the best and most authentic parts of their personalities. Protagonists are

especially selfless parents, and their self-sacrifice and compassion won’t go

unnoticed, even though adolescents might take it for granted for some time.

Reflecting on areas of parenthood that are especially hard, like dealing with

rebellious teenagers, can allow people with this personality type to see what aspects

of themselves they need to improve or balance.


The following brief exercise can help Protagonist parents take negative interactions

with their teens and turn them into learning experiences:


   •   Think of a recent argument or misunderstanding with your adolescent.

   •   Imagine how the teen felt, then write down how they may have felt during this

       disagreement (frustrated, angry, misunderstood, hurt).

   •   Write down any reactions (or expectations) that may have been unreasonable.

   •   Consider how these unreasonable reactions or expectations may have

       exacerbated frustrations during this disagreement.

   •   Finally, take a moment to consider what type of response would respectfully

       get the point across while also maintaining an understanding of the teen’s

       opinions.



                                 Conclusion
Parenting is one of the most challenging experiences that anyone can face,

regardless of their personality type. Protagonists have their own unique strengths,

such as inspiration, altruism, leadership, and integrity, that they can leverage, as well

as weaknesses they can try to understand and overcome to build positive, proactive

relationships with their children. Parents have tremendous potential for personal

development, and Protagonists can gain a much deeper understanding of

themselves and others if they use this opportunity to do so.


Every child is different, and parents are the best judge of what their children need.

The advice provided above is based on general growth stages for children and basic

strengths and weaknesses that many Protagonists share. Use this information

however it works best; if any of the advice or guidance adds additional stress,

frustration, or burden, set it aside. For special situations, such as behavioral or

medical issues, it’s best to consult with a professional pediatrician or pediatric

psychologist to come up with a plan that works best for everyone involved.

                               Better Self, Better World


Unlike some idealists who simply dream of a better and more just world,

Protagonists work tirelessly to spread their message. War, poverty, racism: These are

some the most fundamental problems we face as a species. Many see these ills as

unfortunate but ultimately the way of the world, therefore trying to change them

would be futile. Protagonists, however, balk at this apathy and instead dedicate their

lives to eradicating one or more of society’s ills through action and community

involvement.


Once Protagonists have a goal in mind, their motivation is nearly unparalleled among

the types. Their urge to learn and improve themselves doesn’t come from a desire to

simply be better, but rather to be better for those around them. As summed up in a

quotation from author Joseph Campbell: “We’re not on our journey to save the world,

but to save ourselves. But in doing that, you save the world. The influence of a vital

person vitalizes.”




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      178

Protagonists take the moral obligation to better themselves for the sake of others

and apply it to their studies. They don’t learn just to learn, they learn with a purpose.

Every book read, every essay written, and every debate they engage contribute to a

well-rounded education that will aid them – and others – in the future.


                                     Honing a Vision


Protagonists are beyond diligent when it comes to their studies. People of this type

are famous throughout history for their extraordinary impact on the world: Consider

the likes of Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. Protagonists’ campaigns often begin

with learning, then are seen through with dedication and hard-honed vision. They

have the rare ability to focus on both breadth and depth. Their missions have the

capacity to change things, but they are general enough to be broadly applied.

Whatever their mission, they will discover it through studies of both subjects and

people, then apply all their focus. This can be anything from ending poverty to

creating a comic that gives representation to the underrepresented. For

Protagonists, the possibilities are endless.


From the time they’re young, Protagonists have acute emotional ties to those around

them. Their motivation comes from wanting to create a better world for people, and

they create plans in which they are the catalysts that launch revolution. For young

Protagonists, when their teacher asks what they want to be when they grow up, they

often have a clear idea in mind, as well as sustained intent that follows them well into

their adult lives.


This may manifest itself as joining the newspaper staff in high school, then majoring

in journalism at college, with the eventual goal of winning a Peabody Award for

investigative journalism examining the government of a far-off, neglected,

impoverished country. They begin with emotion, then develop a vision, and then

begin to map the steps from point A to point B.



                     How Protagonists Learn
There is no right way to learn, and every single type has their own unique style of

processing information. Protagonists’ style of learning is heavily influenced by those

around them, and often, it is a powerful tool that fuels the machine. By developing

and balancing their natural style, Protagonists can optimize and enjoy the process of

learning.


                           Balanced Learning Habits

                                  Considering Impact


In addition to being attentive listeners and careful thinkers, Protagonists possess an

insatiable curiosity, directed particularly at humanistic enterprises, whether directly

or indirectly, such as engineering. For Protagonists, such activities represent the very

essence of humanity at its best. They are likely to agree with the following quote from

the film “Dead Poets Society”:


             “We don't read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and

             write poetry because we are members of the human race. And

             the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law,

             business, engineering – these are noble pursuits and necessary

             to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love – these are

             what we stay alive for.”




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       180
                                                                         Academic Path


Protagonists are more than just motivated by creative and artistic endeavors – it is

often one of the reasons they love life. Although they certainly make themselves

knowledgeable in many fields, from the physical sciences to math, economics,

business, and beyond, they always feel most at home being of service to the heart

and soul of human expression, using those many subjects to that end.


That’s why when it comes to school, Protagonists are often concerned with what their

work portrays. It’s about more than needing to please the public; they strive to fulfill

a need in the people whom they’re trying to help. Although they value their original

goals, Protagonists may pivot if they see a certain direction being more beneficial to

their intended audience. It’s less about “How do I feel about this?” and more about

“How can this best help others?”


                                   Trying the Mundane


Although Protagonists prefer and specialize in subjects that have great meaning to

them, they also understand the need to learn “mundane” skills. In day-to-day life,

examples include filing taxes, filling out a check, and changing a tire. In an academic

context, this could mean taking time to develop long-term study habits for classes

they don’t enjoy. They do so because they understand that such skills, though not

dreamy and inspiring, are necessary to managing everyday life and advancing their

inspirations.


Rather than shrugging off the things they aren’t inherently interested in, Protagonists

dig in their heels and commit to at least attempting to master the material in front of

them. They are propelled forward by the sense that the march through the swamp

of mundanity is only temporary, and that the skills they’re learning will soon support

the work they consider meaningful.

                                                                         Academic Path


                         Unbalanced Learning Habits

                                     Tied to Others


Protagonists are so intertwined with the emotions and needs of others that they run

the risk of being held back by them. For example, while learning, they may slow their

own learning pace to match that of their self-designated pack. Protagonists push

hard to raise others during their own rise. If others can’t rise, they gladly take the

time needed until even the last member can cross the finish line. No matter how

noble that may seem, Protagonists ultimately starve their own academic ambitions

to satiate another’s.


In group work, Protagonists often get hung up trying to help everyone succeed. They

are susceptible to getting caught up in their emotions: They want to “give voice” to

others, but they ultimately risk undermining their own confidence – and grades.


                                Obsessing about Impact


Solving the unsolvable can take a toll on even the hardiest individuals, and

Protagonists can exaggerate this tendency. They shoulder the burdens of the world

and are at risk of being crushed beneath the weight. Feeling that they personally can’t

be at peace until they help everyone, Protagonists can become obsessive in their

learning behaviors, leaving little time in their schedules for relaxation and self-care.

In extreme cases, Protagonists may even skip meals or lose sleep as they study

through their lunch breaks or read late into the night.


These workaholic tendencies, though intense, have limits to their scope. When left

alone too long with their thoughts, Protagonists may develop “tunnel vision,”

relentlessly pursuing areas of study that seem most relevant. They may even



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        182

temporarily eliminate all forms of enjoyment and relaxation to reach their goals

more quickly. However, this can put their bodies and mental well-being under

immense stress, as well as diminish the quality of their work.


                         Rebalancing Learning Habits

                                Making Themselves Equal


Protagonists go out of their way to meet the needs of those around them and ignore

their own desires in the process (in extreme cases, they may be completely unaware

of their own needs and desires), which leads to an unbalanced approach to learning.

To rebalance this, they should develop a valuable skill: giving their personal priorities

the same importance they give to others’ needs.


Doing so may feel selfish for these dutiful types, but learning this skill leads to a more

fulfilling life. Protagonists can start by first acknowledging their desires, even while

considering another person’s perspective. Some steps to get there:


   •   Listen to the other person’s perspective.

   •   Write down the pros and cons of that perspective.

   •   Write down the pros and cons of your own approach.

   •   Take points from both to create the most evolved approach.


Protagonists can listen to others while also giving their own ideas equal weight,

allowing both parties to have an enjoyable and enlightening learning experience.


                               Combining Rest and Impact


Food, sleep, and even leisure time are all necessities, not luxuries – a fact that

Protagonists are much quicker to remind others of than to accept themselves. When



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         183
                                                                        Academic Path


people with this personality type make personal sacrifice a routine, they soon find

that they have nothing left to give. It’s important for Protagonists to make these

necessities a priority, not an afterthought.


Protagonists may need to purposefully schedule time for meals, rest, and relaxation.

Using an alarm can be a good reminder to take a break. And quality can be as crucial

as quantity. A series of two- to three-hour naps interspersed throughout the day

don’t equal eight hours of uninterrupted rest, though a 20-minute nap in addition to

nightly rest makes a tremendous difference. Also, a fast-food burrito gobbled down

during a commute may provide needed calories, but it can’t compare to a balanced

breakfast. Protagonists can use the following considerations to determine their

needs and then meet them:


   •   Consider how you’re currently spending your time. Are your primary needs

       being met? Before answering, consider what you would expect to be enough

       for any of your loved ones. Would you chastise a friend for taking a small nap

       after a heavy study session or encourage self-care?

   •   If your primary needs are not being met, ask yourself: How can you meet your

       needs in short increments? 10 minutes for a nap? An hour to cook a good

       meal? 30 minutes of cuddling with your significant other?

   •   Schedule in your calendar some time every day, at the same time, to fulfill one

       need. Such moments, no matter how small, are important to rebooting the

       brain and body. A 20-minute nap helps people focus, a healthy meal fuels the

       body, and time with a loved one provides inspiration.

                 Protagonists in High School
In high school, Protagonists are likely to establish their vision then make an effort to

do what needs to be done to achieve it (e.g., extracurricular activities, concurrent

jobs, volunteering, community-oriented decisions). This may include taking action to

support any goals they may have for higher education.


This behavior can be a balanced approach, where they strive to get what they can

from the opportunities of high school. But they can become unbalanced if they burn

themselves out by taking on too much or if they get discouraged by the scope of their

vision.


                                  Selectively Brilliant


When discussing an individual Protagonist high school student, teachers of differing

subjects may feel like they’re talking about completely different people. Some

teachers may see the Protagonist student as bright, focused, and driven, but others

may wonder why they don’t consistently see those traits when the student is in their

class. For example, one project may be inspired while another is clearly a generic “get

the grade and move on” piece of work.


When Protagonists connect with a subject, they may appear to be brilliant and

forward-thinking in the essays they write, whether in response to the deeply moral

themes of Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment or the stirring history of the American

Civil Rights movement. Although their classmates may see such work as a tedious

but necessary hurdle to overcome on the path to graduation, Protagonists may

experience the kindling of a passion that holds through their adult lives.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        185

                                Learning for Authenticity


The humanities and social sciences strike a natural chord within young Protagonists’

hearts, but they often experience dissonance when they are exposed to less soulful

studies. No topic is beyond Protagonists’ grasp, but without some means of putting

rote facts, figures, and seemingly arbitrary calculations into a broader human

context, Protagonists may perform poorly, or only just well enough to move forward.

Their lack of interest in such classes may frustrate teachers and parents alike, both

of whom may struggle to comprehend how academic passions could be distributed

so unevenly.


Protagonists’ curious behavior is a consequence of their steady inner compass,

lending them a warm and fierce integrity that makes them mature beyond their

years. At a time when their peers’ identities are malleable as clay, Protagonists are

stubborn marble. Others’ approval matters to Protagonists, but remaining in sync

with their ideals always matters more. They hold themselves to a very high moral

standard, and they don’t need to fit in if it means going against their ideals.


                       Balanced High School Learning

                            Remaining Open to Possibilities


A fortunate few Protagonists may encounter teachers who supply inspirational

context for every stray fact or theorem, who discuss topics more deeply than the

facts that will be on the test, who explore why the information taught matters. Most

of the time, however, Protagonists need to sharpen their contextualization skills on

their own to excel in subjects that don’t come easily to them. Protagonists with a

balanced point of view put into context even those subjects they don’t naturally

embrace. They can see each topic as a necessary component of their broader goal


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      186
                                                                         Academic Path


and recognize that every vision comes with sometimes unpleasant tasks along the

way. For example, sketching the chemical structure of a hydrocarbon may seem like

busywork – until Protagonists begin to ruminate on the possibilities of chemistry to

solve world hunger or cure devastating diseases. The motivating potential of

Protagonists’ passion cannot be understated.


Protagonists who take a balanced approach to high school learning open themselves

up to alternatives. They may look to the Socratic paradox for inspiration: “I know one

thing: that I know nothing.” Such Protagonists recognize that hard and sometimes

unforgiving work is needed to make their visions a reality, and that they always need

to expand their knowledge base. They gather their well-rounded insights and take

meaningful steps toward realizing a better world.


                                   Realistic Standards


Protagonists subscribe to a work ethic that correlates directly with their passion, and

they tend to keep working without breaks when their passions are ignited. They

dislike the idea of leaving their commitments and moral obligations unfulfilled. That

said, Protagonists who approach their studies with a balanced mindset aren’t keen

on sacrificing their health to meet a goal, nor are they overly perfectionistic. They do

what they can to turn in quality work but avoid agonizing over the details when

there’s little to gain. They schedule time to commit the effort needed to succeed, but

they set realistic expectations.


Protagonists also aren’t completely against letting loose every occasionally. They take

their interests very seriously, yes, but they aren’t completely against hanging out with

friends on a school night – taking time to remember that they’re just teenagers. They

don’t expect to have everything figured out; much of their joy is in the discovery.

                     Unbalanced High School Learning

                                  Dismissing Details


Protagonists who spend math class doing work for a more interesting course or more

pressing project aren’t demonstrating traditional teenage rebellion, but their grades

can plummet as surely as if they spent their time shooting spitballs or sending secret

texts. In a larger sense, Protagonists who pursue their narrow scholarly obsessions

with no concern for the broader curriculum may discover that their knowledge gaps

limit them in unforeseeable ways. Budding environmentalists with a tenuous grasp

of the underpinnings of climate science will find that their convictions only convince

the already-converted.


Protagonists who indulge only in their interests may establish the troublesome habit

of ignoring finer details, hindering their progress even in classes that interest them.

Young Protagonists with a passion for history intuitively understand the importance

of individual events without feeling the need to memorize actual dates for a test, but

that can affect their grades. Students with a more literary bent might have points

deducted from even the most articulate essay due to a failure to properly cite their

sources. Protagonists’ refusal to meet the demands of a rigid curriculum can hold

them back, both short and long term. A few such bad experiences may cause them

to drift away from an academic path that previously felt like destiny, in which they

could have done lots of good.


                                Impossible Standards


Other hurdles for Protagonists to overcome in high school are their relentless and

uncompromising vision and ambition, which all too often manifest as work that is

turned in late or not at all. Unbalanced Protagonists tend to bite off more than they


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       188

can chew, sometimes refusing to be compassionate to themselves by taking paths

that aren’t as stressful. Protagonists may discover they can’t possibly get done what

they set out to achieve in the time allotted, leading to stress and rushed work. They

may even believe that it isn’t worth it to “settle,” deciding not to complete a project at

all if it isn’t the absolute best work possible.


High school students are faced with frequent, non-negotiable deadlines. Unbalanced

Protagonists, with their Judging trait, are likely to work for 48 hours straight to try to

hit the target, often leading to burnout and incomplete work. Then, even with their

effort, they’ll be exceptionally hard on themselves for their perceived failure, judging

themselves for not being a good enough student to do things properly.


                      Rebalancing High School Learning

                                  Forming a Connection


Learning about details, no matter how mundane, is an important part of life. Ask any

student who has graduated high school – only to wonder how to apply for financial

aid for college, how to interview properly for a job, or how to keep track of future

deadlines. Protagonists try not to neglect their work, but they may feel reluctant to

lend the same passion to everyday details as they do to their visions. To rebalance,

they must choose to have faith that routine, technical, day-to-day information will

prove its value.


When Protagonists have trouble in a course, here are some suggestions:


   •   Remind yourself that just showing up counts for something.

   •   Approach the instructor and ask for guidance.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        189
                                                                          Academic Path


   •   Develop a mentorship relationship with the instructor (or teacher’s assistant

       or fellow student who is excelling in the course).

   •   Focus on the that person’s point of view, filtering the course through their

       perspective – it’s no longer just geology, it’s “Ms. Smith’s passion for the Earth

       expressed through teaching, a childhood dream that found a way into the real

       world.”

   •   Take any information gained and apply it to the course with new insight.


When coursework becomes more personal, Protagonists can look at some of the

details – cited sources, dates memorized – as a favor to the teacher, something they

are geared toward naturally. It’s not the teacher’s fault they have to hand out tests,

so it’s not fair to the teacher (or to Protagonists themselves) to punish them with

poor performance.


Protagonists are perfectly capable of dealing with mundane tasks if they find a way

to make them personally relevant. By creating a relationship with someone else

involved in a task, the topic and its specifics become more relevant, boosting

Protagonists’ motivation and attention.


                          Tempering Unrealistic Expectations


High school can be difficult. With the added pressures of the future, parents, peers,

and extracurricular activities, it can be exhausting, perhaps downright back-breaking

to expectation-laden Protagonists. When they commit, they always try to do their

best; if something has to give, they often sacrifice themselves to sustain their other

obligations.


Protagonists who learn to take a kinder, more measured view of themselves may find

worth taking pride in. Sacrificing themselves under the weight of idealized

expectations is not the way to go. In an academic context, young Protagonists can

develop healthy school-life balance by creating a schedule. This will not only boost

their productivity, but also allow them time to hang out with friends, be alone and

relax, and enjoy their lives as teenagers, rather than burning out trying to meet

unrealistic expectations. Some suggestions:


   •   Create a fixed schedule. Work when you need to work, and rest when you

       need to rest. Dedicate time to study, then stop when that time is over. Setting

       a schedule allows Protagonists to have an “off” button they usually deny

       themselves, making it a personal act of kindness, as well as a sanity saver. An

       example: one hour of dedicated studying time during school hours (study hall,

       perhaps) and two hours after school.

   •   When it is time to study, focus on the most important or time-sensitive tasks

       first – an essay due tomorrow, followed by 50 math equations due by the end

       of the week, followed by 30 minutes of reading to finish an assigned novel by

       the end of the month.

   •   Limit distractions to only what’s relevant. Turn off your phone, log out of

       social media, and remove yourself from social situations that could keep you

       from doing your work.

   •   Relax after time is up. When the designated study time is over, stop and do

       something relaxing and rewarding, maybe finally sit down to finish the TV

       show you’ve been missing for two months.


By tempering unrealistic expectations, Protagonists will find themselves in a more

balanced state of mind. With this mindset, they’re better able to achieve their goals

and enjoy their time as a teenager.

      Deciding Whether and When to Attend
                                    College
Though Protagonists are by many measures an uncommon personality type, they

face a common dilemma when leaving high school: Should they immediately go into

the world of work, or should they continue their studies?


                                   Choosing College


For some Protagonists, the choice is moot: Academic certification is required in many

fields they might be drawn to, including education, psychotherapy, health care, and

law. Without a college education, they will find that those doors remain locked. Such

Protagonists have a non-negotiable stopover on their journey to becoming whom

they wish to be.


For those who choose college, the experience doesn’t have to be a chore. Many

Protagonists find their crusade to improve humanity to be an integral part of the

curriculum, as well as an important part of their extracurricular activities. Through

the simple camaraderie of so many like-minded people – finally! – their flower of

rebellion has space to bloom.


                                    Choosing Work


Some Protagonists choose work over college, whether they cannot bear the costs of

college (personal, financial, practical, or principled) or their zeal for change is so

potent that it just can’t be deferred any longer. No longer guided by the educational

system and having less and less parental oversight, such Protagonists need time to

define themselves and their goals. It’s reasonable to work in entry-level positions,

such as waiting tables or doing physical work, while continuing a path of self-


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      192

discovery. Working to explore interests and perhaps save money for future schooling

is a balanced reason to delay school in favor of work.


Others know full well what they want and find rewarding careers or work for

themselves. They might also take paths somewhere in between, for instance, using

recognition for their community service to secure a role in a not-for-profit

organization, or using their passion for writing to sell freelance articles while still

dealing with the reality of paying the bills.


It’s important for Protagonists to realize that many roads can be rewarding. If they

truly wish to build a better world, they’ll find a way to do so, even if their role is

different than they or others had originally anticipated.


                           Balanced Decision-Making

                                   Embracing Honesty


The important thing is for Protagonists to consider their options with unwavering

honesty. The difficulty of this task shouldn’t be underestimated. Protagonists know

perhaps better than anyone how good people are at deceiving themselves, but even

though they see it in others, they are not immune to it themselves. Protagonists who

recognize this very human tendency within ask themselves questions, consult with

friends and mentors, and do other reality checks that help them gather a range of

opinions and information to help orient and clarify their worldviews.


Any option can be either just the challenge Protagonists need to move their visions

forward or a means of escape from the weight of responsibility. It can be all too easy

to convince themselves that one is the other. Protagonists, when honest and patient

                                                                          Academic Path


with themselves, distinguish between an obstacle and an excuse, then make

progress.


                                   Following Through


Protagonists leaning toward college understand that it’s a long commitment, though

following through on a conviction is hardly a challenge for people with this

personality type. They recognize that time spent toward self-improvement isn’t an

exercise in narcissism, especially if it provides them with the credentials necessary

for entering a helping profession that delivers good to humanity, or a complex

intellectual and moral framework for handling the personal or global problems they

long to solve.


When taking a balanced approach, Protagonists embrace the idea that college isn’t

an abdication of responsibility but an acceptance of it – if time there is used

effectively. On the opposite side, Protagonists who don’t seek out college can still find

ways to advance their goals. Even a humble job in the service industry can be

meaningful if they find satisfaction in a community of coworkers and customers. It

can also support them financially while they volunteer for a social cause as their

“true” career, especially if the skills developed during their volunteer work make them

more viable candidates for positions in the nonprofit sector.


With this acceptance, Protagonists dedicate themselves to challenging but necessary

coursework while maintaining themselves with much-needed relaxation. They

balance their time and energy between the self-respect gleaned from a powerful

mission and what’s needed to make them happy in the moment.

                          Unbalanced Decision-Making

                                     Eternal Waiting


Protagonists can develop the unhealthy habit of spending their whole lives waiting

for the perfect opportunity to arrive. The period after high school is a time of

exceptional personal consequence, and younger Protagonists can allow the

weightiness of decisions to become unbalanced, exaggerate it in their minds, and

sink to inaction. There’s something better right around the corner, they may think,

while letting opportunity after opportunity pass them by. Their intuition, though a

powerful tool, can work against them as they imagine a perfectly formed solution

falling into their lap.


This combination of imagination and rumination manifests itself in Protagonists’

inaction. They may wait for signs from the great unknown to dictate their next course

of action – something that feels like the universe is specifically telling them to become

an author or to go to XYZ University. They may spend more time trying to decide

whether something feels right rather than taking the action needed to make it feel

right. Protagonists who spend years agonizing over a course of study or path to

employment eventually see that little was gained from the excessive deliberation,

and perhaps much was lost.


                                  Haunted Rumination


Choices that are later seen as “wrong” have a way of haunting people with this

personality type. Living with choices is as necessary as making choices in the first

place, but when Protagonists overanalyze not only future decisions but also decisions

they’ve already made, this unbalanced view gives them little chance to develop the

self-confidence or self-forgiveness to see them through.


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        195

What they may not realize is that rumination is a decision. It’s a decision not to act

and not to progress, which can cost far more time than school or a more intentional

push into the professional world. Protagonists may be so afraid of making the wrong

choice that they make no choice, instead falling onto a path that doesn’t align with

their personal values. Ten years hence, their regret is likely to be that they are no

closer to their goals because they never acted.


                       Rebalancing Decision-Making

                                   Adjusting Course


There is a fine line between deliberation and procrastination, and Protagonists need

to work harder than most at distinguishing between the two. Once committed, they

might refuse to modify a decision despite mounting evidence that’s it’s just not right

for them, whatever their expectations may have been. This tendency toward delay

stems from Protagonists’ need to commit once they have chosen a course of action.

But when nothing can be undone, the only choice is a well-considered decision.

However, what counts as “well-considered” can be stretched to infinity. The question

is whether this deliberation arises out of sensible caution or a fear of the unknown

and a lack of the self-confidence needed to step into that abyss.


Protagonists should try to understand that few decisions are permanent. Changing

their mind based on new information isn’t only their prerogative, but a sign of

maturity. Snap decision-making feels unnatural to Protagonists, but those who err a

bit more on the side of rashness – at least compared to their usual resolution – may

find that even when they make a wrong choice, the consequences are not nearly as

irreversible as they had feared.

Here are some tips for Protagonists adjusting their educational course, as it’s never

too late to act:


    •   Request a tour of a local university.

    •   Visit an organization’s or campus’s website to look at the events calendar.

    •   Attend an orientation of a university or local college.

    •   Request an informational interview at an interesting company or non-

        governmental organization.


These actions require no commitment – and that’s a good thing. Protagonists should

feel no pressure to sign up for anything they don’t find compelling. Hopefully, though,

they will feel the rush of inspiration again and be off on another life chapter.



           When Protagonists Choose College
                         Higher Education with Higher Purpose


Younger Protagonists who chafed against the curricula of high school will be pleased

by the more diverse and inspired university environment. However, although the

liberty of higher learning can be a boon to budding Protagonists, college can have its

challenges. Protagonists who are lulled by the siren song of endless electives and

roving Socratic discussions may be rudely awakened by far steeper expectations and

workloads inherent in university endeavors. Not to say their expectations of college

are illusory – Protagonists are likely to bloom into creative thought leaders. But first,

they must conquer their expectations.


Nevertheless, bridging this gap propels Protagonists through life, and college can be

an amenable staging ground for the battles to come. Their guiding spirit of principled

rebellion, though misunderstood in the more rigid environs of high school, may serve

them well in college, where they are likely to encounter professors and classmates

who encourage precisely this type of pushback.

                                  Understands Others


Protagonists may struggle to reconcile the utopian ideal of a university with the

realities of campus life. Things that may disappoint and perhaps even confuse them

are other people’s general apathy toward learning and their emphasis on simply

getting a good career. However, Protagonists make it a point to try to understand

others through communication and an open mind.


Protagonists who wish to understand others must remember that compromise is

essential, even if it sometimes feels like politics. They needn’t compromise their

values, however. After all, the changes they strive for are usually social ones, and no

movement for social evolution has rested entirely on the back of one person, no

quest for equity on unilateral action. Forging alliances to broaden acceptance is an

essential skill for Protagonists to master. Fortunately, they’re excellent listeners, and

if they learn to incorporate what they hear into what they say, they can build support

for their ideas.


                             Learning Beyond Coursework


Protagonists enjoy classes within their discipline, but the same general education

courses that left them cold in high school are no more compelling in their college

incarnations, and they are just as much a requirement. Protagonists who summoned

the discipline to conquer these obstacles during high school may have less trouble

doing so now that they have at least the semblance of choice in the matter. They can

intersperse less desirable courses throughout their degree program, pairing them

with courses they enjoy to balance their course load.


Protagonists realize that the necessary and the desirable go together. They may roll

their eyes at basic prerequisites like introductory composition, perhaps marveling at

their peers’ poor writing or shallow thinking, but what they must learn isn’t

determined by those peers. Protagonists recognize the value of their time and

commit to learning what they can from basic and advanced studies alike by pushing

themselves and being creative with opportunities, not by taking a syllabus at face

value. They know that in every course, their education is in their own hands.


                      Unbalanced Approach to College

                                  Weight of the World


Protagonists, when taking an unhealthy approach, pursue their studies with the

weight of the world on their minds, an all-or-nothing attitude that often exacerbates

the pressures of mere academic performance. Such high expectations may press

Protagonists to go beyond healthy means to succeed.


Aside from the financial burden that a lengthy college career can exact on

Protagonists – whose academic debts might later force them into a profession that

fulfills their fiscal needs while robbing them of their spirit – the mental toll shouldn’t

be underestimated, either. Even in the absence of family or work responsibilities (and

students often have either or both), Protagonists in college who burn too brightly risk

flaming out far too soon.

                                   Focused Elsewhere


Protagonists may have several missions and responsibilities, and they are likely to

devote their attention to areas where they’re impassioned, even if it doesn’t involve

their coursework (especially less interesting coursework). People with this

personality type may instead focus their attention exclusively on a charity they’re

volunteering for or a student organization they aim to lead one day. Although they

still care about their coursework, it ranks low on their list of priorities and, at times,

may be completely abandoned.


Such hyper-focus leads to a situation where they don’t have the time to fulfill any of

their responsibilities particularly well. They may spend so much time gathering

information, campaigning, attending meetings or socials, or working on one thing

that they leave no time for their higher education.


                  Rebalancing Their Approach to College

                                  Balancing the Burden


For Protagonists who feel restless in a purely academic environment, internships and

volunteer work may bridge the gap, not only giving them the sense that they are

already “being the change they wish to see in the world,” but perhaps also shortening

their post-college transition into that world. Protagonists can overburden

themselves, though. A full course load is often more than enough to handle on its

own, and although unpaid work may eventually lead to a more suitable career,

Protagonists who are simultaneously supporting themselves with a part-time (or full-

time) job may not have the luxury of devoting their attention to anything more than

what is already on their plate.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         200

Though college should be taken seriously, Protagonists need not see everything they

do as a matter of apocalyptic concern. Even they need to blow off steam, because

refusing to make time for less mentally and emotionally taxing pursuits is a recipe

for burnout. Aside from making sure they get out into nature or to a festival or fair

from time to time, Protagonists may want to ensure that their course schedules

always include a “fun” class, whether it directly relates to their chosen major or not.

Here are steps for Protagonists who want to let loose without any guilt:


   •   Ask yourself, “Would I advise my friend to take a break every so often?”

   •   Set aside an hour every day that is dedicated solely to self-care.

          o This time should have nothing to do with personal development – no

             learning a new language, trying out computer programming, or

             volunteering for a cause. This time should be focused exclusively on

             relaxing your mind and body.

          o Don’t do anything with this time that stresses you out.

          o Do something you wholeheartedly enjoy that doesn’t feel like work (e.g.,

             watching a guilty-pleasure TV show, taking a long and luxurious bubble

             bath).

   •   Schedule the rest of your time around that daily hour of self-care. Map out the

       rest of your schedule to distribute your work equally throughout the week so

       your self-care won’t be eclipsed by cramming for a test the next morning.



                           Lifelong Learning
Lifelong learning goes beyond the rigors of school, though a return to academia is

certainly an option. Older Protagonists who have embraced themselves fully are

better able to give the benefit of the doubt to areas of study or schools of thought

that might have struck them as irrelevant or worse in their younger years.


                                   Forever Learning


Of all the personality types, Protagonists are among those who feel most

comfortable with the prospect of lifelong learning, the notion that education isn’t a

thing one may possess, nor something one must get from some institution, but that

it is instead a never-ending journey into the unknown. They know that their hunger

for knowledge can never be truly fulfilled, just as their yen for justice can never be

sated, and they find joy in that quest.


                          Balanced Lifelong Learning

                                Finding Joy in Learning


Understanding the beauty in a clumsy first effort – like the beauty in a child’s

excitement when they first learn that red and yellow make orange – Protagonists

pursue many things that too many people attempt only in childhood. They can do so

because they grant themselves permission to find joy in their learning – a new

instrument, art medium, or dance style, an unfamiliar sport or game, a distant

campsite, or explorations in nature.


Many Protagonists, when content, continue to learn throughout their lives, not to

prove something to someone, least of all themselves, but for the joy of trying

something and getting better at it. They do something because it’s fun, not because

it serves some greater altruistic purpose (though that is by no means off-limits).

Engaging the world around them with no agenda but curiosity and a light heart

resonates with Protagonists’ deeply cherished authenticity and is perhaps the

greatest expression of what makes these individuals the people they are.


                          Enjoying Learning Over Improvement


Self-improvement is important, but enjoying oneself in the process is even more vital.

Protagonists who decide to take a more balanced approach to lifelong learning

attempt to appreciate the life they’ve developed for themselves, as well as praise

themselves for the skills they have learned. By taking time to practice appreciation,

Protagonists gain a certain self-awareness that lessens the fear that they’re not

learning anything at all, or that they’re “stuck in the mud.” They also cultivate the

ability to separate learning a new skill from needing to perform that skill well the first

time around.


In fact, balanced Protagonists may separate learning new skills from their self-image

completely. They feel accomplished when they succeed at something, but they don’t

base their self-worth upon what they have learned (or failed to learn). These

Protagonists accept themselves as they are but also strive to learn when they can.


                        Unbalanced Lifelong Learning

                                  Stubborn Worldviews


From an early age, Protagonists tend to formulate a cohesive set of opinions about

the world. Those who refuse to adjust their ideas when appropriate find themselves

lacking. They focus on subjects they already have an affinity for, rather than

diversifying their learning, often pursuing knowledge that only supports their

fundamental views. This limits their growth, perhaps even solidifies their ignorance,

as they focus on one thing without truly having an open mind.



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         203

Some Protagonists recognize and compensate for their certitude, knowing that

different perspectives bring forward different and equal truths about the world;

unfortunately, others just allow their beliefs to congeal into an impenetrable

ideological mass. This can conflict with their perception of themselves as

fundamentally correct in their view of the world. While the world changes around

them, these Protagonists may be reluctant to learn about new technologies,

philosophies, or methods, always considering their own to be better than the rest.


                         Making the Magnificent the Mundane


Aside from the diminishing returns of a too-narrow focus, Protagonists who refuse

to work at diversifying their learning and self-exploration risk growing weary of the

very obsessions that once inflamed them. Their over-serious approach to knowledge

robs them of the joy of learning and discovery. When they are unable to divert any

attention from their mission, whether fixing the world’s suffering or exercising their

moral purity, the pure pleasure of a day off to learn a light-hearted skill becomes

perverse and selfish in their eyes.


This unrelenting, adamant nature can hold Protagonists back as powerfully as it once

propelled them forth. Once just one strong argument away from changing the world,

those suffering a severe case of burnout may be equally certain that no such

argument exists – or if one does, it’s everyone else who’s too stubborn and apathetic

to make it. Early cynicism has its disadvantages, but late-blooming cynicism that grips

the heart of an older Protagonist can be particularly devastating. With nothing to

replace their former passion, they can quickly become despondent, so certain are

they that every alternative course was ruled out in their youth.

                         Rebalancing Lifelong Learning

                                   Broadening Scope


The goals that Protagonists pursue are often so grand that they can consume their

lives – and many see little reason to avoid that. Any sacrifice in the service of such

ideals seems a small price to pay for the good they can do. As discussed earlier, this

point of view can easily grow exaggerated and often unhealthy.


Protagonists spend their formative years becoming an authority in their chosen ideal,

but as they mature, they might find at least some of their time better spent attaining

a greater breadth of knowledge. A seemingly unrelated topic could yield fresh insight

into their principal area of concern.


Being “set in your ways” isn’t inherently bad. However, there’s always room to

improve upon an existing routine. Protagonists can begin by exploring the merits of

a contrary opinion rather than sticking to what they already know. Here are some

steps they can follow:


   •   Rather than immediately dismissing an argument, choose to take time to

       understand the other side. Consider:

          o How your own stance may appear to others

          o Some benefits of what the other side is proposing

   •   “Try on” the contrary opinion for a few minutes; during a debate or discussion,

       try switching roles with a person who holds an opposing view.

   •   Based on what you learn, adjust your opinion or viewpoint.


There are always new experiences to have and new things to learn. They don’t have

to be disruptive or life-changing. Once they rediscover joy in learning something new,



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                      205
                                                                        Academic Path


they might choose to stretch their experiences even more. They may find that the

benefit of continued learning far outweighs any risk.


                      Connecting the Mundane to the Magnificent


Protagonists’ greatest peril is that learning can become a joyless process, because

they have a tendency to get carried away with the scope of learning new things. If

they are practicing the violin, for example, they may wonder, “How can I possibly

compare to a master violinist? There’s just so far to go.” Learning stops being fun and

seems burdensome.


To rebalance, however, Protagonists can connect the mundane to make it

magnificent once more. Rather than being something they ruminate upon, learning

can become an opportunity to reconnect with friends, family, and community. Such

reconnections are what make humanity beautiful, and that upwelling of pure positive

emotion can breathe new life into the darkest struggles. Simple mindfulness

exercises are a good way to do this:


   •   Find an object to focus on (a plant, a cup, a body of water).

   •   Take a few minutes to focus on the object’s simplest aspects: its colors,

       textures, scents, physical features.


This simple exercise takes only about five minutes, but it can pull Protagonists out of

a bad head space and into the reality around them as they focus on what’s in front

of them in the moment.

                                  Conclusion
                                    Life Is Learning


Education means a lot of different things to a lot of people. For Protagonists, it’s a

way to advance their goals in life to help protect and serve others. But it can be so

much more if given a chance. Protagonists’ challenge is not so much in the hard work

of learning. It’s more about managing expectations and finding a reasonable pace so

that learning does not become a soulless drudgery or an overwhelming burden, but

a rewarding experience that adds to life. For Protagonists, balance involves blending

their determination and heart with pragmatism and realistic expectations – a balance

that is quite achievable.


They can achieve balance by taking time to meet their own needs, setting plausible

expectations for themselves, focusing on finding meaning and merit in the mundane,

understanding that an A+ doesn’t equate self-worth, and allowing themselves room

to fail and to be wrong, celebrating failures right alongside their accomplishments as

learning opportunities.


People are never solely balanced or unbalanced. All of us go back and forth, evolving

and devolving. Balance is more akin to seasons as they come and go but always

repeat. The trees become taller, people become wiser, all of us advancing in our way.

Progress comes when we learn how to deal with the seasons, and it is an extension

of the personal growth journey.

               Professional Development




Because Protagonists are such a driven personality type, one of their primary

challenges is finding a career that’s in line with their ideals in a world that may not

often share them. Although many careers are well-suited for this type, analyzing the

different aspects of any job can help them find a professional role that speaks to

their personal values, strengths, and goals.


Throughout this section, we will discuss how understanding their traits can help

Protagonists excel in their professional development. We will examine what may

frustrate them or create imbalance, as well as how they can use their strengths to

regain balance and thrive in their careers. We hope this guide will give Protagonists

the understanding and perspective needed to use their abilities to forge a fulfilling

career path.

                      Jobs and General Skills
                                      Career Options


We’re talking about professional development to help Protagonists gain a deeper

understanding of the role their personality type plays in finding and excelling in their

chosen careers. Vocational and personal growth are interwoven, and they take place

across all stages of life, from early education through retirement. Gaining increased

self-understanding – by discovering values, goals, strengths, and weaknesses – is an

important consideration for Protagonists and helps them decide on a career path

and the best means of following it.


People with this personality type do their best work when their jobs combine

creativity, compassion, and opportunities to take on challenges. Teaching,

psychology, and social work are a few examples of careers that combine these traits,

but Protagonists can shine in many fields. They are unlikely to feel comfortable in

strictly impersonal roles or those with extensive rules.


With freedom comes responsibility, but Protagonists shouldn’t be afraid to explore

all their choices. It’s unlikely that someone with this type will have difficulty coping

with obligations – Protagonists’ tactical preference for Judging keeps them on track,

and their Extraversion helps them face the unknown with relish.


                                   The Career Search


In the following sections, we will discuss how Protagonists can make the best use of

their assets to find a suitable career and succeed in it. This includes ways they can

excel in their job search, how to understand and develop their workplace habits, and

tips for communicating effectively with managers and coworkers based on their

                                                                 Professional Development


personality types. We will also outline some specific professions Protagonists might

consider. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but it provides some insight

about the role that personality type plays in choosing an ideal career.


                         Suitable Career Options for Protagonists


Let’s look at some fields that are likely to align with Protagonists’ ideals and strengths.

We won’t offer a full list of professions, as too many choices would make our

coverage both unwieldy and inadequate, and the list would grow longer daily.

Instead, we will offer a sampling consistent with Protagonists’ personality traits, with

explanations about what makes them suitable.


Keep in mind that this isn’t a firm prescription of what Protagonists must do to find

success or happiness. Rather, we hope it provides some insight as they decide on

their own. For Protagonists already employed, this may serve as an explanation of

why they’re happy or unhappy where they are. “What do I want to do for a living?” is

a good starting point for many types – but for Protagonists trying to forge their

future, important questions when searching for a career include, “What can give me

meaning, purpose, and joy?” “What do I want to be?” and “What problems do I want

to solve?”


                                  Careers with Meaning


Protagonists love to find meaning in their work through connections with people,

inspiring others and helping them grow. This need to nurture others makes careers

in health care rewarding for them. However, what counts as “meaningful work” is

subjective, and individual Protagonists may be able to blend their principles into

almost any honest job. Although some careers well-suited to typical Protagonist traits

are listed in the following sections, it’s by no means a restrictive list.


                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         210
                                                               Professional Development


Protagonists can satisfy their nurturing impulses in many ways outside the helping

and educational professions. While working as grocers, for example, they can help

direct customers toward healthy, delicious food, changing their lives for the better.

For Protagonists, meaning comes from engaging challenges head-on with bold

idealism and connecting to people with energetic, considerate care. They can do this

anywhere they wish.


                              Utilize Creativity and Insight


Not only do Protagonists need their careers to provide meaning, but they also yearn

to express themselves creatively. They may have difficulty in jobs where they aren’t

allowed to let their ingenuity blossom. Jobs where they can use their insights to effect

real change in others’ lives bring them the most satisfaction. For Protagonists, money

and Employee of the Month awards can’t compare to a life of values and principles

brought into reality through creative and fearless action.


Therefore, Protagonists may find it hard to meet their needs in corporate

environments that force them to manage practical policies that favor profits over

ethics or human cost. Management does not always recognize or reward creativity

in places where paperwork and handbooks overshadow personal expression. So,

people with the Protagonist personality type often express independence by finding

flexible leadership positions or starting their own businesses.


                     Combining Personal and Professional Growth


Using their drive for personal growth to advance their professional lives – and, in

turn, their professional lives to develop their personal growth – is often the most

rewarding part of Protagonists’ careers. They’re drawn to positions where they can

make a significant difference, and they aren’t afraid of competition, pressure, or


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        211
                                                                Professional Development


responsibility. Many other types strive for materialistic or egoistic career goals such

as an enviable salary, an impressive title, or a specific number of subordinates. These

goals alone aren’t enough for Protagonists.


For people with this personality type, professional growth is about cultivating skills

and understanding – within themselves and their teams. Even if they try to convince

themselves that they should aim for more typical rewards, deep down they’ll always

sense that they can do better. This makes it difficult for Protagonists to fall into a rut

– and that’s great news for everyone. People with this personality type have the

capacity to achieve great things when they put their determined idealism to work.


Recognized as elegant communicators, Protagonists often aim for expressive careers

in creative areas like writing blogs, stories, and screenplays. Music, photography,

design, and art are reasonable alternatives, as well. They allow Protagonists to focus

on deeper themes of personal growth, morality, and spirituality. By developing their

craft with new approaches and perspectives, Protagonists often shine a light on

society’s flaws and expose their own for all to see.


                                       Health Care


Counseling, psychology, and medicine speak to two of Protagonists’ key motivators:

compassion and a sense of purpose. People with this personality type gravitate

toward growth and self-development, which are the hallmarks of those fields.

Protagonists also enjoy helping others gain insight into and control over their lives,

and positions in these disciplines offer these Extraverted types opportunities to use

their social skills while working with their clients or patients.


Protagonists’ impressive charisma and strong sense of purpose often make them

inspiring figures to those in need of mental, physical, or spiritual healing. With their


                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         212
                                                                 Professional Development


dedication and personal convictions, they are very well-suited to positions where

they care for and guide others, and they revel in such work, treating it as a sacred

duty. When Protagonists can lead others into a better life, they feel rewarded and

their value confirmed.


Some job examples include:


   •   Alcohol- and drug-addiction counselor

   •   Marriage counselor

   •   Psychiatrist (with an emphasis on psychotherapy)

   •   Psychologist

   •   Social worker

   •   Physician

   •   Nurse practitioner

   •   Physician’s assistant

   •   Career counselor

   •   Religious worker

   •   Healthcare administrator (if allowed to pursue a vision)


                                         Education


Growth and learning are central to Protagonists’ approach to the world, so teaching

and working with students suit them well. Imaginative Protagonists connect with

younger students using their energy and empathy. With older students, they provide

an idealistic perspective and present their subject with passion and creativity,

especially if they teach the humanities. With adult learners, Protagonists are

inspirational, connecting to their students with respect and wisdom.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       213
                                                                Professional Development


Regardless of who they teach, Protagonists are keen on treating their students as

individuals with distinct traits and needs. As Extraverts, they find constant contact

with students and colleagues throughout the day energizing, enjoying both the social

give-and-take as well as the sense that they’re changing lives for the better.


Protagonists’ interest is in the uniqueness of their students as people, though they

may regard standardized tests and other tools as having some potential. They do

well as administrators or in other leadership roles as well, bringing their determined

vision to the overarching structure of their institutions. As with health care, they do

better as visionary, creative leaders rather than strictly practical ones. Such jobs can

include:


   •   Preschool, elementary, or high school teacher

   •   College lecturer (especially in religion, philosophy, or literature)

   •   Adult-education teacher

   •   School principal (but mostly as a visionary)

   •   Guidance counselor

   •   School psychologist

   •   Religious educator


                                 Public and Social Work


Protagonists thrive on values-based causes and the pursuit of justice in the purest

sense. They’re at their best when chasing some larger truth. Other types might

choose a career in law for the challenge of winning, the thrill of finding solutions, the

rush of making a great argument, the drama, the power, the fame, and the fortune.

However, those enticements alone don’t seduce Protagonists. Although they may




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        214
                                                                 Professional Development


appreciate exciting legal challenges, Protagonists are more likely to practice law to

ensure that values are upheld, and society becomes a bit fairer.


Law is not the only profession that helps them pursue such goals. Any chance to

create a better, more equitable world gives Protagonists professional meaning.

Protagonists’ ideals are their underlying motivation, but their understanding of how

people work and fit into a larger context, not to mention their steady determination,

makes them potent agents of change. Combining well-organized thoughts with a

broad vision often creates arguments so robust that all but the most unreasonable

opponents end up agreeing with them.


This way of thinking helps in several jobs well-suited to people with this personality

type:


   •    Lawyer (especially at not-for-profit firms)

   •    Diplomat or liaison

   •    Local political representative

   •    Investigative journalist

   •    Novelist or blogger



                         Challenging Career Paths

Exploring personality types is helpful in steering people in the right career directions,

but this is by no means prescriptive. There are likely hundreds of examples of

individuals who don’t fit the mold and are happy in jobs conventional wisdom would

suggest otherwise. “Challenging” here refers to typically not compatible, but of

course some can find fulfillment in jobs that are unusual for their type. It’s rare for

people to get everything they want out of their work lives, and trade-offs often come



                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       215
                                                                 Professional Development


into play. The following describes typical challenges for Protagonists in the job

market.


                          Disheartened by Routine and Pressure


Protagonists fall flat in work that focuses on impersonal concerns, is mundane, or

involves heartless conflict. Accounting, auditing, data analysis, and similarly grinding,

data-heavy work easily leaves Protagonists fidgety and unfulfilled. They need “warm-

blooded” work, filled with humans and human potential.


The core problem that Protagonists face is that the knowledge underpinning the

passion takes time to build. Likely, their first few professional roles will involve a fair

amount of mundane, uninspiring work. Ideas, cues, meaning, and self-realization are

supreme for Protagonists on the job. Unfortunately, finding them in the soulless

grind of grunt work is difficult at best. In such situations, Protagonists can still benefit

by building inspiring and useful human connections.


                               Difficulty Choosing a Career


Protagonists find that many corporate career paths aren’t designed for them, but

rather those motivated by status and financial gain. Not that making a healthy living

and receiving respect are somehow wrong, but such rewards are often

compensation for a lack of more fulfilling work. Protagonists need something more

than a paycheck and prestige.


This doesn’t mean that Protagonists have difficulty seeing choices. In fact, they’re

likely to face the opposite problem – many Protagonists struggle to begin a career

early on because they see 10 wildly different paths forward, each with its own




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          216
                                                                 Professional Development


intrinsic rewards. Such choices are alluring, but they can also be heartbreaking

because each decision means abandoning many other possibilities.


                         Cold, Repetitive, or Data-Driven Work


Protagonists need their positions to have a personal touch and prefer to focus on

the human (or the humane). Factory or data-entry jobs are not a good fit, as work

revolving around something rather than someone just leaves Protagonists unfulfilled.

They need work that has “soul.” Their work must feel purposeful and creative, so

repetitive tasks, in general, are unappealing to Protagonists, and social isolation

leaves them bored at best.


It’s important to point out here, however, that some fields – among them, science,

technology, engineering, and mathematics – have a reputation as coldly rational and

excessively data-driven. Although they’re technical and data focused, many careers

in these fields also require creativity and insight, and their goal often is to make the

world a better place.


Protagonists can bring a compassionate approach to some of the global issues that

these fields address. Their Intuitive trait can prove valuable when they are forming

ideas and engaging in expansive problem-solving, and their Extraversion can enable

them to share a group’s vision in compelling and effective ways.


                           Loose Principles or Unclear Values


Protagonists struggle in any industry that doesn’t have clear social responsibilities,

even more so if they believe the work might be doing harm to others. Businesses

revolving around vices, such as casinos, can leave many Protagonists feeling guilty.

Seemingly neutral work like investing or managing money may feel shady to



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         217
                                                                Professional Development


Protagonists if they sense the business somehow takes advantage of others or is part

of some greater systemic problem.


Even in otherwise ideal roles like mentorship or charitable outreach, Protagonists

feel uncomfortable if the company they work for has earned a bad reputation with

its behavior, such as misuse of funds. Protagonists need to consider whether

management’s values align with their own. They need a company culture that values

integrity and reliability in the service of something they support before they can settle

into a job, regardless of the position.


                                     No Social Time


It’s important that Protagonists have many opportunities to engage with others.

Their Extraverted and Feeling natures create a deep need to interact with others to

feel fulfilled, in both their personal and professional lives. Work that separates

Protagonists from other people leaves them feeling starved, though they may

continue such a job anyway if it serves their ideals.


Although they have the discipline to excel anywhere they choose, Protagonists’

greatest ideas and accomplishments often occur when they can put a human face

on their motivation. Roles that allow them to feel as though their work will positively

affect other people can help them continue their effort even when they are working

alone. Nonetheless, they’ll have far greater energy when social contact is a part of

the job.

                            Career Alternatives

The traditional path is not for everyone. With their resourcefulness and ingenuity,

many Protagonists often wander into unexpected career directions. In this section,

we’ll explore alternatives to the conventional job market.


                                     Self-Employment


People don’t need regular jobs to live comfortably. We live in an age of possibilities,

and selling one’s time to a corporation isn’t the only way to earn money. The working

world has changed radically, and spending multiple decades at the same job is no

longer the norm. Outside a few specialized fields such as medicine and the military,

long-term employment contracts with retirement benefits are atypical.


So, working independently may be a better choice for some Protagonists. Self-

employment has many benefits, such as the ability to plan one’s own time, the

tangible results of one’s work, and, of course, self-direction. Protagonists value

autonomy and creative freedom; being their own boss gives them such

opportunities. Furthermore, self-employment solves one of the major hurdles that

Protagonists are likely to face in a corporate environment – forced loyalty to

questionable practices and ideals.


Many creative fields allow self-employed Protagonists to make a living, such as

photography, graphic design, interior design, freelance writing, information

technology, website design, and translation services. Hobbies and pastimes often

translate into self-employment opportunities.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       219
                                                               Professional Development


                                Professional Volunteer


A daring and inspiring alternate career choice for Protagonists is that of professional

volunteer – making income second to the larger goals of changing the world.

Although unlikely to lead to financial prosperity, this path offers unparalleled

personal satisfaction. If supported by income from other sources (perhaps part-time

work, family, a partner, or a spouse), Protagonists who devote themselves to matters

of conscience and human development can move mountains. In addition, this is an

option they can transition into later in life, bringing skills from previous occupations

into the nonprofit world.


If Protagonists want to offer such help, the least developed countries are hungry for

compassion, dedication, and helping hands, and any skills and knowledge can be of

use. A résumé of abilities with a passionate cover letter may allow Protagonists to

enter many different organizations as volunteers. If they can accept a potentially

austere material life, the rewards to the soul are endless.


However, foreign aid work and a monastic lifestyle aren’t mandatory – many

volunteer opportunities are available closer to home. Administrative and fund-

raising roles abound at the headquarters of any idealistic organization, from

grassroots political groups to religious and secular charities. They appreciate the

willing minds, hearts, and voices of enthusiastic Protagonists who want to pitch in.



                Getting on the Career Ladder
Now that we’ve discussed many career paths that may be suitable for Protagonists,

we will look at how people with this personality type can approach their job search.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        220
                                                                 Professional Development


In this section, we will touch on contacting prospective employers, making a résumé

stand out, and preparing for an interview.


Although applying to and interviewing for jobs can be stressful, Protagonists’

excellent communication skills and ability to approach subjects they care about with

clear dedication and passion tend to make them appealing candidates. Their charm

and social skills are likely to be an asset.


                                      Making Contact


Thanks to their inherent ability to connect with others and the natural influence that

arises from it, Protagonists usually have a good idea of how to approach prospective

employers in the right way. Their intuition is a powerful tool. Mapping out potential

networks, crafting introductory emails, and presenting themselves in a positive light

– these come naturally to Protagonists, and they shouldn’t hesitate to use such

strengths.


Protagonists are convincing and have the strategic thinking and imagination

necessary to develop a very personal approach. One compelling email sent to the

right person is often much more impactful than hundreds of random, cookie-cutter

applications. When Protagonists take the time to research the companies they’re

applying to, they begin to imagine themselves in those positions. When they start

drafting their cover letters, it’s as though they already belong, and it shows.


Of course, Protagonists need to be able to present their skills in the right way to

distinguish themselves from other candidates – these types shine in creative,

collaborative work. The buzzwords “excellent people skills” have become such an

inseparable part of job requirements that stressing such competencies in interviews

is a must. Protagonists thrive in bustling groups that are trying to make important


                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       221
                                                                Professional Development


things happen. Being able to express this skill honestly, rather than using buzzwords

for their own sake, makes an impression in the organizations Protagonists appreciate

most.


                                Relating Outside Interests


Not all companies think to ask, but organizations rarely want employees with no life

outside work. Protagonists can take some time to think about what hobbies could be

somewhat applicable to prospective employers and then find a way to turn those

ideas into real-life projects. Opportunities abound – they can engage in competitions

or volunteer projects, build an online presence (e.g., a blog), or travel. Such activities

appeal to Protagonists anyway, and if becoming a more appealing candidate is part

of the inspiration to do something exciting and worthwhile, so be it.


The projects don’t necessarily have to involve the same skills that potential jobs

would. In whatever way Protagonists can show that they’re able creators, they can

refer to those successes on their résumés. Not only does this make Protagonists

more attractive and versatile candidates, but it gives them breathing space in their

interviews. Answering certain interview questions such as, “Describe a situation

where you used your problem-solving skills,” is much easier with a list of successful

projects ready to be cited.


Protagonists are often eloquent speakers and presenters, and they can develop an

online profile to make the job hunt easier. Employers often Google prospective

candidates or check out links included in résumés. An applicant may get some bonus

points if their résumé highlights a hobby such as writing a blog about a specific field.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         222
                                                               Professional Development


                              Preparing for the Interview


Protagonists’ enthusiasm and dedication are usually clearly visible when they are

competing for a job they’re passionate about. In an interview, Protagonists can focus

on discussing the prospective job as an intensely personal interest and highlight the

role they want to play in it. People with this personality type become even more

diplomatic and charming as time goes by, so they don’t have any difficulties moving

such conversations along.


Despite their inherent communication skills, Protagonists may want to spend some

time preparing their presentations. Even their excellent natural abilities can be

“tuned up.” Before an interview, they might find themselves daydreaming about the

implications of the work they’ll do once they get the job, while forgetting to prepare

for the nuts and bolts of the interview itself. This is a trap people with the Intuitive

trait can fall into.


Protagonists need to be aware of the most common interview techniques and

questions, so they aren’t caught off-guard by something like, “What’s your biggest

weakness?” Answering with “perfectionism” and “I work too hard” may be honest

responses, but they’re also familiar enough to be clichés. When interviewers are

looking for self-awareness and introspection, these responses cut off any

opportunities to offer deeper answers.


Protagonists should prepare to answer many templated questions, especially in the

early stages of a job search, with something approaching enthusiasm. Sometimes

recruiters don’t even know much about the positions themselves and are simply

going through a checklist. If Protagonists go in expecting that, they can be ready to

put unique and memorable spins on even the most routine questions.

               Protagonists in the Workplace




After the contracts are signed, after Protagonists settle into their jobs and serve as

exemplary employees – then what? How can they progress in their careers while

staying true to themselves, and what difficulties are they likely to face? In the

following paragraphs, we’ll discuss Protagonists’ possible paths forward.


                          Balanced Workplace Habits

                                 Practicing Leadership


Protagonists can be excellent team managers who bring people together. They

instinctively know how to promote goals and motivate colleagues, defusing conflicts

and building group cohesion. Individuals with this personality type care about the

feelings of those in the workplace, and they try to get to know everyone, seeking to

understand what drives and inspires their coworkers.


With Protagonists’ outgoing nature and their ability to grasp the big picture, they can

layer inspiration on top of any other practical skills they may have. Willing to take the

lead, they go beyond simple tasks, preferring instead to conduct missions of a



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        224
                                                                Professional Development


grander scale, and they usually don’t need to hold a formal leadership title to

influence those around them. Their friendly enthusiasm, vision, and charisma put

them out front regardless of job title.


                                   Authentic Creators


Protagonists are likely to find innovative ways to look at their work and authentically

creative paths to succeeding in their jobs. Even though they are too interested in

harmony and the welfare of others to be very rebellious, they are, nonetheless,

always thinking about doing a better job. They are willing to try more unorthodox

means, and they think doing so is in everyone’s best interest. They are not necessarily

rule-breakers, but they are creative enough that they might find themselves

challenging the status quo or at least suggesting many improvements to it.


If Protagonists are asked to follow a script or procedure manual without adding their

own spin, they are likely to feel unfulfilled. All roads lead to growth for Protagonists;

for them, that means developing their creative influence and being able to add it to

any endeavor. Anything less feels like drudgery and a rejection of the potential they

believe is within them. Fortunately, innovative thinking is likely to be an attractive

quality in the modern job market.


                        Unbalanced Workplace Habits

                       The Problem of the Compassionate Worker


Protagonists avoid the allure of power and rarely strive for leadership roles, but their

charisma, organizational skills, and vision often place them there. They may not be

comfortable in a hierarchal position or may even reject a formal title. But they

commonly lead anyway. Sometimes their leadership is from a lateral position rather



                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        225
                                                               Professional Development


than from a higher, formal one. And when they lead, their approach to life can cause

them difficulties as they balance the objectivity an influencer needs against their

appreciation for compassion.


Protagonists are prone to getting emotionally involved. They find it difficult to be

impersonal and detached, and the emotional troubles of coworkers or subordinates

affect Protagonists deeply, without some healthy shielding of their emotions.

Empathy, in its raw form, is positive; but empathy without acknowledging the bigger

picture can be difficult in the workplace.


In a broader way, Protagonists focus on the greater good but also struggle to tolerate

an “ends justify the means” attitude. Though productive, they usually dislike an

impersonal, results-oriented approach. Nonetheless, “results” are a business reality,

so they may always struggle to balance their ideologies against productivity. This can

create a series of tensions that Protagonists may need to directly address. However,

they also dislike conflict, believing there is always a way to keep all parties happy

through understanding, compromise, and integrity. Their efforts to strive for such

harmony further complicate any efforts toward evening out the demands of

leadership, productivity, and the Protagonist heart.


                                  Stubbornly Creative


Protagonists excel in roles where they can help other people grow and develop, both

within and outside their organization, while still staying faithful to their principles.

This ideological stance demands a degree of independent and creative thought, but

when Protagonists lose perspective, they may protect their own ideas too vigorously.

Their normal tolerance toward the opinions and standards of others may suffer

during such times.



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        226
                                                                  Professional Development


Although Protagonists suppress negative feelings almost by instinct, when they are

insecure, they can be quick to show displeasure, with a black-and-white approach to

their passions. If the organization they’re working in helps them manage these traits,

Protagonists have no difficulties progressing in their career. If the company has a

less-than-ideal mission statement or a purely dog-eat-dog culture, however,

Protagonists struggle to square their ideals with such thinking and may need to find

another position.


                       Rebalancing Workplace Habits

                             Learning to Compartmentalize


To prevent focus on the wrong issues, Protagonists may want to fine-tune their need

to be involved with others. Constant conflict with managers, who will likely become

more resistant to that conflict over time, can make further moves in their career

difficult. People with this personality type often sacrifice their needs, wishes, or

workplace accomplishments to help others, but moderation is key if they want to

succeed. Protagonists set themselves up to do more good for those they care about

if they can prioritize business only when it’s truly necessary.


Learning to fit different work roles at different times and in different situations is a

skill that leads to professional success. If people limit themselves to one role, the

powers-that-be may even consider them limited in a more general way and doubt

their usefulness. Protagonists will likely never lose their compassionate cores.

Without fear of becoming something they don’t want to become, they can confidently

try out other roles, in effect complementing their central personality traits. They can

be both a caring person and a results-oriented worker without inner conflict.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                         227
                                                                  Professional Development


The follow exercise may help Protagonists get a better sense of what it means to

enjoy varied roles while remaining true to their values and core characteristics:


   •   On an index card or small piece of paper, list across the top all the roles you

       play in an average day. For example: student, parent, employee, manager,

       housekeeper, family finance manager, driver, lawn maintenance person.

       Include at least five.

   •   Draw a column under each role. For an entire day, each time you play one of

       the roles on the card, put a tick mark in the column.

   •   At the end of the day, review the tick marks. How many different roles did you

       play in a day? At the end of the day, did it make you a different person?


Learning to compartmentalize and vary their roles and views of themselves can help

Protagonists more fully grasp that sometimes empathy is the key to effectiveness,

but other times a more objective style is needed. Sometimes a job might call for a

compassionate leader. Other times, it might call for a practical money manager.

Appreciating the flexibility needed to move among various roles can help

Protagonists better navigate the workplace.


                                    Restoring Openness


Secure people usually don’t spend much time defending themselves and their own

ways. When Protagonists are stubbornly creative, it is likely that they feel a threat to

some or all their three core growth motivators: self-confidence, self-respect, and self-

esteem.


Protagonists’ natural inclination is to be open to and encouraging of others.

Oppositional behavior tends to make them uncomfortable, and that discomfort can

signal a need for self-evaluation – typically a loud signal. When these types resist


                                “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       228

someone else’s suggestions, they may have to review their motivations: Do they

oppose the ideas because they believe they are right? Or are they defiant to protect

the things that give them value and assurance? If the latter, is there a real assault

they need to protect themselves from? Or do they, perhaps, need to build themselves

up in other ways? An exercise to test their thinking:


   •   Watch or listen to a news program and list 10 or more things you can disagree

       with while watching.

   •   Make three columns on a piece of paper. Label them:

          1. “I disagree because they are wrong, and I can prove it.”

          2. “I disagree on some gut level that I can’t explain.”

          3. “I disagree because of my basic values, which I can explain.”

   •   Place the items you disagree with in the appropriate columns. Highlight those

       you perceive as threatening to your values or your beliefs in any way.

   •   Simply making yourself aware of the reasons you might disagree with

       something can be enlightening.



       Workplace Cooperation Between Types
Much of who people are at work is revealed through how they interact with others.

four type groups. It includes brief reviews of collaborative traits and potential

obstacles, as well as some tips that may help them navigate the tricky waters their

similarities or differences may create. Efforts are inevitably more productive when

members of a staff recognize the many gifts various personality types offer one

another, and they find positive ways to thrive together in the workplace.

               Balanced Protagonist–Analyst Cooperation

                                       Big Ideas


Neither Analysts nor Protagonists like to deal with details, though Analysts like the

idea of details. Both prefer to deal with the big picture instead, absorbing knowledge

almost subconsciously and then incorporating it into a larger constellation of

Intuitive understanding. They’re both imaginative and creative, connecting the dots

in often deep ways. This compatibility and love for the more abstract give them plenty

of common ground.


Protagonists and Analysts both like to work with ideas. Their imaginations

manipulate their ideas into models. They differ in their area of interest: Protagonists

create ideal designs for a perfect society or the perfect workforce, whereas Analysts

create excellent schemes for a system. Analysts show interest in efficiency, whereas

Protagonists show interest in humanity. When balanced, they recognize and accept

each other’s focus while sharing their contributions freely with an organization, and

they can achieve much together.


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       230

                              Compassion and Efficiency


Protagonists live in a world of values, ideals, and compassion. Analysts are more

comfortable with structures and puzzles. Both share strong views.


Analysts often allow efficiency to outweigh empathy. Protagonists add to Analysts’

offerings by bringing humanity to the forefront. Protagonists understand and even

share strict standards, but they also provide “soul” to any system that Analysts devise

or innovate. However, an organization only about love, peace, and harmony can get

a little mushy around the edges. Rational analysis is an essential ingredient for an

organization to grow and prosper. This is where Analysts contribute most.


             Unbalanced Protagonist–Analyst Cooperation

                                 Consumed by Debate


Although Protagonists and Analysts can use their different foci in complementary

ways, their differences can create conflict. Analysts can be critical of Protagonists’

views and consider them too soft, whereas Protagonists might regard Analysts’ views

as insensitive and without concern for higher values. Agree or disagree, they can end

up on opinionated tangents together, effectively shutting out more level and

practical types like Sentinels and Explorers, who are more interested in getting the

job done.


Protagonists and Analysts working together may spend significant time debating

their different approaches in the workplace. Analyst managers might argue that it

would be more efficient to replace the receptionist at the front desk with a touch-

screen computer, highlighting the time and money saved. Protagonist managers in

the same office would probably bemoan the sterile approach and the disregard for



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       231
                                                                Professional Development


the employee. They may wonder about the welfare of the receptionist, criticize the

lack of human warmth involved in greeting visitors with a machine, or go further by

rejecting any steps toward a society in which human effort is expendable.


                                   Shared Impatience


Analysts can be blunt and impatient with people who don’t see certain points their

way. Protagonists can be similar, if for different reasons. Protagonists’ idealism may

cause them to become combative as well, if Analysts come on too strong and won’t

give ground.


Perhaps most damaging, Protagonists might not let disagreements go if they see

Analysts’ attitudes as habitual tyranny. Analysts, on the other hand, may be

dismissive of the “soft” approach, possibly further infuriating sincere Protagonists.

Protagonists might then extend the conflict for lengthy periods of time, stubbornly

seeking justice.


               Rebalancing Protagonist–Analyst Cooperation

                              Speaking Analysts’ Language


Protagonists find willing conversation partners and allies when they begin to ask

Analysts “why” questions and maintain a willingness to explore their views on issues

such as workplace organization. Perhaps most importantly, Protagonists can shed

(or at least set aside) their fear of asking their Analyst coworkers for clarification when

they’re confused by an idea or comment. This also gives Protagonists a chance to

make a counterargument. It’s not that Analysts disdain the human side of things –

sometimes they just forget to consider it.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          232
                                                                 Professional Development


Analysts are pleasantly surprised by individuals who are interested enough in

furthering their understanding by asking them to explain their opinions or

comments. They even like when someone challenges them – but only if it grows the

discussion and is not too excessive.


Conversely, Protagonists respect and appreciate coworkers who understand the

noble intentions beneath their calculated efforts. When it comes to occupational

issues, they’re more interested in getting their thoughts and ideas across than

making friends; ironically, they often make friends with those who are receptive to

that approach, such as Analysts.


A quick guide to what Protagonists need to know to communicate better with

Analysts:


   •   Recognize your differences. Although you have much in common, your

       perspectives can be markedly dissimilar.

   •   Adopt a “why” rather than “who” approach. That doesn’t mean Analysts totally

       disregard the “who.” It just falls a little lower on their list of primary concerns.

   •   Ask for further explanations to reveal an Analyst’s rational framework. Don’t

       be afraid to challenge them a little when it’s appropriate.

   •   The lack of a warm demeanor does not necessarily mean a lack of respect or

       a lack of appreciation. Don’t assume a contentious relationship exists simply

       based on an emotionally cold presentation.


Protagonists are not enemies of Analysts’ rationality. Powerful results are possible

when Protagonists choose to focus on shared interests rather than differences.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                          233
                                                                 Professional Development


                              Speaking Protagonists’ Language


Protagonists can help Analysts understand how to communicate with them by

promoting questions and statements that include “who,” rather than just “why” or

“how.” The more time they take to understand their Protagonist coworkers, the more

likely Analysts are to learn what ideals and values propel people with this personality

type. In doing so, they can gain a more nuanced understanding of how Protagonists

approach work.


Protagonists can also moderate their reactions when confronted with challenging

opinions from Analysts. Two sharp minds with different perspectives can combine

their ideas in productive ways and develop collaborative results. Protagonists may

come to understand the value of a purely tactical approach, and Analysts may

eventually see the energetic efficiency created when people work in harmony

together.


A quick guide to help Protagonists and Analysts speak the same language:


   •   While being sensitive to each other’s differences, remember that neither

       approach is superior to the other. Proper balance requires both parties to be

       sensitive to the basic traits of the other while being assertive (not aggressive)

       in presenting ideas.

   •   A “yes, and …” approach sometimes helps. “Yes, I understand the need to

       increase daily productivity, and we need to make sure that our coworkers have

       enough breaks and balance in their day, so they can give their best.” Try not to

       directly oppose ideas; instead, add information and alternate perspectives.




                               “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       234
                                                               Professional Development


   •   Show Analysts how your goals are the same (for example, caring for clients

       and employees can help a company meet its objectives and result in more

       profits).

   •   Gently remind Analyst coworkers that emotional expression and influences

       are not necessarily vacuous. Emotions carry their own rationality, and Analysts

       are likely to respect that if they understand how the two go together.


Protagonists are usually not shy about presenting their ideas. However, anybody can

be intimidated by approaches that are not their own. When working with Analysts,

they should remember that their point of view is as valid as the rational ideas

Analysts present. Respectful assertion can make such relationships more productive.

Two Diplomats have the advantage of speaking the same language. Diplomats,

including Protagonists, are visionaries who focus on growth and humanity. When

they talk, their discussions sometimes wander into areas others might see as

impractical, but they usually have a significant purpose despite their sometimes-

sparse attention to necessary details. Facts are essential, but they play a supporting

role to the grander ideas so important to Diplomats.


Protagonists find ready conversation partners in other Diplomats, as they all enjoy

discussing matters of principle. Other coworkers may discuss the nuts and bolts of

an organization. Protagonists and Diplomats talk to each other about creating

harmony and growth within a company, and they define success as individuals

increasing their potential by committing to ambitions that exceed self-serving

interests.


                                   Idealistically Driven


Although they can appear excessively idealistic, Diplomats agree that a better way

and better world are possible. Their values are important to them, driving their

decisions and attitudes. Protagonists and their Diplomat colleagues can transform

their transcendent discussions into action, but not all Diplomats are as action

oriented as Protagonists. If Protagonists exercise their influence and natural

leadership qualities, then they can help balance out the dreamy inaction of those

who are less hands-on.


Such action, when shared by Diplomates, targets injustice or unfairness in a business,

and Diplomat colleagues may form strong alliances around such matters. They’re

cause driven, and they understand each other when such problems arise.

Protagonists and their Diplomat coworkers agree that a cold and calculating business

that’s willing to sacrifice or mistreat people to meet its goals needs fixing.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       236

            Unbalanced Protagonist–Diplomat Cooperation

                       An Overabundance of Guiding Principles


The problems Protagonists and other Diplomats may have when working with one

another have nothing to do with understanding. However, they may have trouble if

they become stuck in their style of thinking, inadvertently excluding the insights of

those who think differently – especially if they’ve labeled certain types as thinking

“conventionally.”


In business and life, it’s good to have varied personality types around to provide

balance. Too many Diplomats brainstorming in one room may produce a great many

guiding principles but few details that involve turning a profit in the process (which,

regardless of appeal, is usually necessary to keep things running). They do well when

it comes to mission statements or other visionary materials, but precise tactical

planning may not be their strong point when their synergy is unbalanced.


Diplomats may even fall into the deeper trap of dismissing others’ attempts to apply

some practical realism to the process as merely “negative,” regardless of the intent

of such efforts. Although many consider inspirational goals an important launching

pad toward the future, without a concrete “how-to” strategy, even willful Protagonists

can find themselves struggling to move forward with their big ideas. Endless

discussions about such matters can do more harm than good, and Diplomats may

need perspective and a dose of reality from other personality groups.


                                When Ideas Dominate


Another issue for Protagonists and Diplomats is inaction. Because outgoing

Protagonists usually choose to act on their ideas, they may become frustrated with



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       237

other Diplomats, especially those who are strongly Introverted. Although empathetic,

they can lose patience with those who merely talk about their feelings and ideas

without applying bold action.


Protagonists are initially supportive of the imagination of other Diplomats, even

sharing in it, but they naturally expect to subsequently externalize those ideas with

hard work and dedication. “All talk and no action” is likely to try Protagonists’

patience.


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Diplomat Cooperation

                                 Bring Details on Board


Learning to tap into other Diplomats’ imagination and creativity is mutually

rewarding. When Protagonists and their Diplomat coworkers dig deeply into each

other’s reservoirs of ideas and dreams, they can move idealistic mountains.


However, the Diplomat group contains many of the rarest personality types, often

with outsider perspectives on the world. Voluntary committees can easily become

cliques, and they may struggle to put ideas into real action. To avoid this:


   •   Consider inviting more practical types from other personality groups to the

       discussion. Perhaps a Sentinel (_SP_) can aid with logistics or an Analyst (_NT_)

       can put a more rational spin on the discussion.

   •   Set agendas for meetings with specific topics and time allotted for each topic

       to avoid meandering conversations. Agendas might include “old business” as

       well as “new business” to clear any distractions and establish continuity.

       Someone taking the role of secretary can be helpful.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       238

   •   Implement a rule that each thing discussed must lead to a measurable action.

       For example, if the topic is worker morale, perhaps start by implementing an

       anonymous survey measuring employee satisfaction. Appoint a “sergeant-at-

       arms” to monitor and stress that measurable actions are required during

       meetings.


Although the exercise describes formal meetings, informal discussions can borrow

from it. The more structured Protagonists and the Diplomat colleagues make any of

their conversations, the more likely they are to lead to results.


                                     Time to Think


Protagonists must give other Diplomats space to process material on their own.

Diplomats must understand an idea before they’re comfortable moving forward with

it, especially when dealing with sensitive subjects or information. When they finally

move forward, they thrive on appreciation.


Protagonists rarely have trouble here, but if they’re frustrated or impassioned, they

may let niceties fall by the wayside. And speaking up and sharing information do not

come naturally to the Introverts in the group. Here are some suggestions to shift

everyone’s thinking in a more results-driven direction and to help preserve healthy

conversation:


   •   Set deadlines. It’s fine to take time to think, but too much time becomes an

       excuse for inaction. Make sure to cap the time for pondering ideas.

   •   Stay on task. Motivate each other so as not to get too lost in thought.

   •   Provide gentle encouragement to inspire each other to continue providing

       valuable contributions.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       239

   •   Start with the end in mind: What do you hope your meeting or conversations

       might accomplish? Continually remind yourself of the goal to stay on track.


Taking time to map out thoughts on an issue is prudent. But like anything, balance is

vital. Protagonists can shine here and help other Diplomats who engage in lengthy

rumination move forward.



                Protagonist–Sentinel Cooperation




              Balanced Protagonist–Sentinel Cooperation

                                 Standing for Others


Protagonists focus on ideological matters, whereas Sentinels concentrate on

practical matters. But both find their joy in supporting others and protecting their

welfare, leaving the two types much to talk about.


Sentinels might focus on completing the payroll and guaranteeing all receive their

salaries, whereas Protagonists might work to ensure salaries are on par with the

needs and efforts of the staff. Both derive energy and self-respect from contributing



                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       240

to the happiness and security of others. As a team, they address both the material

and emotional needs of those affected by their work.


                               Spanning the Spectrum


For Protagonists, the big ideas are the most important. They’re interested in growth.

Anything that comes across as a “minor detail” may feel unimportant to them, so they

sometimes miss small but essential items. Sentinels don’t, and organizations need

their diligence to run smoothly. However, Sentinels can get so caught up in details

and procedures that they lose the larger purpose of what they’re doing.


Partnerships between Protagonists and Sentinels help them hold onto the greater

vision of their organizations. This is especially true when it comes to issues like

finding practical ways to support human capital. If both respect each other’s

strengths, they can form powerful teams, combining idealism with the know-how

that makes it all work.


             Unbalanced Protagonist–Sentinel Cooperation

                          Concrete and Abstract Perspectives


Protagonists’ worldview comes from an almost subconscious linking of information

and feelings, and they are always imagining something better. However, their ideas

can be hard to convey in concrete, realistic terms. Sentinels protect efficiency and

order by using accepted standards and methods. To have value to them, things must

be proved. In a way, they try to connect working practices from the past with the

needs of the present and future, hoping that will guarantee similar results.


Protagonists and Sentinels apply those same standards to their coworkers as well.

Protagonists appreciate less tangible qualities like thoughtfulness and vision,


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       241
                                                               Professional Development


regardless of proven skill, whereas Sentinels look to previous work performance –

loyalty, seniority, and proven results are critical considerations for them in any

workplace relationship. This can leave either or both feeling too judgmental to

connect on a meaningful level, leading to a sense of non-cooperation in a workplace.


                                       Judge Not


Sentinels might judge Protagonists as too ensconced in impractical ideas without

concrete outcomes. Protagonists might judge Sentinels as too pedestrian or as

lacking imagination. Treating Sentinels as somehow “generic” cuts Protagonists off

from their practical experience and hands-on perspective.


Each could be complementing the other, but their judgments might set them in

opposing corners. Companies lose resources when divergent personality styles fail

to appreciate each other’s value, and stubbornly insisting that one style is superior

to the other limits the contributions of the person doing the insisting.


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Sentinel Cooperation

                                 Finding Commonality


Protagonists may be tempted to view Sentinels as unimaginative or rigid, but the

efficiency and stability they offer are necessary to any organization – when they

commit, they get things done. Keeping that in mind when trying to communicate can

help. When Protagonists minimize abstract terms, and focus on concrete steps, not

only can they cooperate more efficiently with Sentinels, but the approach also helps

them tame their more abstract ideas so that they become part of concrete solutions.


For example, Sentinels can feel lost when faced with some vague but impassioned

notions, such as the importance of stable work schedules to human dignity. To them,


                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       242
                                                                Professional Development


it just sounds like anger untethered from practical results. To help resolve such

miscommunication, Protagonists might try the following:


   •   Present information in practical terms.

          o In relation to the above example: An employee has eight hours between

              shifts, but it takes one hour for the round-trip commute to work. People

              need eight hours of sleep, but this employee is only able to get seven, if

              that. By breaking down this problem in concrete terms, Sentinels and

              Protagonists can work together to come up with a solution for this

              employee. Sentinels care about people, too. They just need things to be

              constructed differently.

   •   Avoid expressing things in terms of ideal and abstract notions.

   •   Consider asking Sentinels for direction. Although Protagonists have plenty of

       organizational skills, details are not always part of their big-picture approach.

       Working side-by-side with a Sentinel is likely to put you in touch with those

       details.

   •   Set clear, incremental targets when working with Sentinels. They’re not slow,

       but when they commit, they put considerable time and energy into getting

       things done. They want to know they’re using that focus effectively.

   •   Show appreciation for what they do, rather than pointing out what they could

       do differently; it can go a long way in improving cooperation.


For Protagonists working with Sentinels, focus is best placed on turning the abstract

into the concrete, the broader perspective into the more specific. This doesn’t mean

Protagonists have to abandon their ideals or points of view; adding a practical

dimension will help.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       243

                            A Single Perspective Isn’t Enough


These two personality types can resolve their problems by understanding that both

worldviews have something to offer. Practicing patience in the face of pronounced

differences is good advice that both can embrace. Both Protagonists and Sentinels

should be careful not to judge their coworkers’ approaches to their jobs as wrong

merely because they’re unfamiliar.


Phrases like “That’s the way we’ve always done it” or “That’s what you’re supposed to

do” hold little weight for Protagonists. Lots of things used to be done certain ways

before they were improved upon, and Sentinels themselves often embrace past

improvements. Taking a step back to reflect on this (patience and thoughtfulness

tend to go together) can go a long way toward moving things along.


Protagonists who hope to help Sentinels work more effectively with them might try

some of the following strategies:


   •   Highlight similar goals. They likely exist, even if they are seen from two very

       distinct perspectives.

   •   Think in terms of results.

   •   Include optimism in the mix. Both want things to be better and for all to benefit

       from their work. That point of common interest may help Sentinels buy into

       Protagonists’ dreams and Protagonists accept Sentinels’ hands-on approach.

   •   To build rapport, talk about rules and established structures with Sentinels.

   •   Be true to your interest in transformative ideas and methods. However, in

       consideration of more traditional Sentinel coworkers, take a gentle approach

       to introducing new ideas.

Protagonists should show Sentinels the value they bring to the table. Fortunately,

Protagonists are perhaps the most organized and action-oriented Diplomats, so

there is plenty to show. However, both types should be careful to avoid being too

dogmatic about their own approaches if they are to make a successful team.

              Balanced Protagonist–Explorer Cooperation

                             Action-Oriented Partnership


Protagonists and Explorers both enjoy moving forward with tasks and finding better

ways of doing things. Finding novel, compelling solutions to practical and concrete

problems stimulates Explorers. They can take a tangled mess of a situation and figure

out how to make it work, often in unique and exciting ways – so long as they’re

allowed to do it their way. For Protagonists, work is more broadly about personal

vision, development, and well-being: problem-solving on a grand scale. They can flip

a fixed idea on its head, creating a whole new perspective.




                            “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       245

Despite their different perspectives, both types respect flexibility, and rules and

traditions don’t bind either type too tightly. Explorers are much more utilitarian

compared to Protagonists’ idealistic pursuit of values, but they share a common

appreciation for innovation and constructive change.


                                  Ideas and Techniques


Partnerships between these two types can offer a lot to the workplace if they can

make it work. Protagonists are great at grasping, creating, and transforming ideas,

but they’re theoretical and thought based, and they often struggle to fit such big

ideas into such a small world. Explorers excel at hands-on activity. They relish

mastery of people, things, and skills within their physical environment. To see

Protagonists’ visions realized, call on Explorers. They can do much together if they

decide to collaborate on a task or project.


Imagine the mood in an organization has grown glum. Protagonists might use their

visionary approach to realize there’s no real sense of community. They can sense

that communication is poor, and they can detect a lack of connection with their

clients and among coworkers. If Protagonists bring this concern and their vision for

a cohesive group to Explorers’ attention, they might create an email newsletter, a

phone chain, a podcast, or a monthly coffee “date” for coworkers to get people

together and build a sense of community. They might generate a brand for the

organization that says, “Community” and, in doing so, also fashion a morale-raising

team of Protagonists and Explorers. These two different pieces of the puzzle have

much potential to fit together.

             Unbalanced Protagonist–Explorer Cooperation

                              Heavy and Light Standards


Although established standards don’t bind either Explorers or Protagonists as tightly

as they might Sentinels, Protagonists do live by a firm code. Their values, usually

connected to their thoughtfulness and ethics, are strong forces in their lives.

Explorers aren’t necessarily amoral, but broad values aren’t always as prominent as

a desire for results in the way they handle business.


Extraverted Explorers enjoy people and are often friendly, outgoing, and fun, building

vast networks of friends and clients – often with little distinction between the two. In

business, the goal is to make money, so they may happily use their personal

networks to sell themselves or their goods. This mixture would almost certainly

offend Protagonists’ sense of authenticity, but to Explorers, it’s just people helping

each other out by making an exchange. To their minds, if everyone involved is happy,

who cares?


                                Deep and Spontaneous


When Protagonists’ values are dismissed, if they are insecure, they tend to respond

poorly. Differences in opinion may lead to biased, negative outlooks, with

Protagonists seeing Explorers as shallow or selfish; conversely, intolerant Explorers

may, in turn, regard Protagonists as “uptight dreamers” disconnected from reality.

Explorers live in the here and now, but Protagonists freely revel in imagination and

thought – it’s the classic conflict between immediate results and long-term ideals.

The answer to this difference is for each to recognize what the other brings to the

table.




                             “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                        247

Consider this hospital metaphor. Protagonists would be the case managers,

equipped to handle the long-term well-being and treatment of patients in a holistic

way. Meanwhile, Explorers would be down in the emergency room, doing triage and

reattaching limbs – they don’t have a month to see how things go. Both have different

attitudes about what it means to save a life – but they’re both saving lives. The two

roles require pronounced differences in approach, plans of action, and styles of

communication, but both are needed to run a hospital.


The potential problem is obvious. Those doing triage may see themselves as the real

heroes, and case managers may believe they make it possible for “real” long-term

healing to occur. This less than cooperative regard – maybe even disdain – for the

value of the other’s style can lead to disharmony and perhaps even harmful

competition.


            Rebalancing Protagonist–Explorer Cooperation

                                     Keeping It Real


Improving working relationships with Explorers requires Protagonists to make a bit

of adjustment to their natural approach to dealing with others. Focusing on how to

make an issue actionable is often vital for effective communication with Explorers.

Protagonists certainly love new ideas, but they can lose them if they get mired in lofty

philosophical theories that are well beyond what’s needed to act. Explorers are

usually more interested in how an idea can be put into practice.


Protagonists have a lot to learn here. They have a clear idea of what the big picture

looks like, but it’s helpful to see details and processes in action as well. Protagonists

can ask questions and participate with their two hands, experiencing the moment

one step at a time. As action-oriented individuals, Protagonists can easily fall into

productive harmony with Explorers, once they move past theory and the work

commences.


Protagonists can facilitate communication with Explorers if they keep the following

in mind:


   •   Avoid the theoretical. Focus on that which can be manipulated physically. The

       more kinetic the better.

   •   Look for the action-oriented common ground. It’s there, but sometimes it’s

       hidden under Protagonists’ broader idealism. Ask, “What is it we want to do

       together?” Think concrete and measurable.

   •   Look for what excites the other person and try to join them in that excitement

       – or at least appreciate that they are excited. Both types are passionate,

       although for different reasons and in different ways.


Nobody is so complete that they can’t benefit from the gifts diverse types bring to

the workplace. In many ways, Explorers are vastly different from Protagonists, and

therein lies their value to each other.


                                  The Power of a Notion


Protagonists tend to extend their values and ideals into their work life as much as

they can, knowing that what drives them will improve communication and

motivation. Explorers looking to cooperate more closely with Protagonist coworkers

can start by asking about their values and connecting those values to real examples.


Protagonists also tend to think big, looking at the broad picture rather than the

specifics or details. A little enthusiasm for an idea with potential goes a long way.




                              “The Protagonist” (ENFJ, -A/-T)                       249

When Explorers can help them turn it into something real, they can be a powerful

team.


Protagonists who hope to help Explorers work more effectively with them might try

some of the following strategies:


   •    Be assertive (not aggressive) in advocating for the things that are important to

        you. Just because Explorers are less interested in values and abstract ideas

        doesn’t mean you have to surrender that part of yourself to work with them.

        However, do so in a diplomatic fashion that sets boundaries while avoiding

        rigidity or hostility.

   •    Show interest in Explorers’ projects. Let them know that, even though you both

        may have obvious differences in your approaches, you respect them for what

        they do best.

   •    As with all Observant types, focus on outcomes. Find common interests there.

        Shared goals can bind workers to each other and build cohesiveness.


These two action-oriented types can be a dynamic force in the workplace if they

decide to shed concerns about differences and embrace them instead. Explorers can

help Protagonists not wander too far into conceptual weeds, and Protagonists can

provide solid ground for Explorers, who often end up on unsteady, shifting sands if

left to their own devices.

Is it a job or is it a mission? Protagonists are likely to say “both.” Protagonists don’t

accept work as a mere job – yet they are not likely to exalt themselves above their

fellow employees who simply want to make a buck. For them, their work life is a

hybrid of a calling and a need for survival like everyone else. When they balance the

two, their enthusiasm and dedication give them an edge. Their charisma,

persuasiveness, and other leadership abilities allow them to impact their workplaces

in impressive ways, and others tend to value their contributions.


Obviously, there is no perfect Protagonist specimen. Despite a common core of traits,

each Protagonist adapts and translates their shared traits into their own unique

expression. And there is no perfect job for any type, nor one that is totally unsuitable.

However, some positions may be more aligned Protagonists’ traits and some less

aligned. Hopefully, this guide can help any who read it find the path that suits them

most, according to their own mission, goals, and values. For Protagonists, that path

is filled with meaning and humanity.

                           Creating a Balanced Path Forward


At their best, Protagonists are noble warriors, working tirelessly to better themselves

and the entire world by bringing their principled yet compassionate approach to

everything they do. The information in this book can help these dauntless souls on

their journey, not just by granting insight into the application of their virtues, but also

by highlighting areas where personal growth can become a pointed focus.


Protagonists can find objectivity and humility difficult, but their strong sense of

connection to others can help them find balance as they learn to welcome the input,

contrasting views, and even criticism of others. They make excellent leaders, but wise

Protagonists are also perpetual students, understanding the benefits of listening to

the people they respect.


Protagonists who seek to achieve their own greatest potential are never afraid to

turn their exacting gaze inward, asking not only whether they are meeting their own

standards, but also whether their standards could use some updating. For people

who derive much of their strength from consistency and structure, change can be

difficult, but learning to adapt their methods and views whenever beneficial is one of

the greatest tools for advancement they can practice.


Improvement is, by definition, a form of change, and flexibility enables Protagonists

to recognize opportunities when they present themselves. Even this visionary type

cannot predict all the wonderful things that might happen, so open-mindedness is

key to reaping the best of what life has to offer. Protagonists’ charisma creates

tremendous potential for bonding with people, and accepting diversity in others

ultimately cements relationships that can last a lifetime.


Although Protagonists may see nearly unlimited potential in life, they can

nonetheless accept limits on how far they can push others to change and respect

others’ right to be themselves. Luckily, Protagonists have hearts as big as their high-

minded vision, so appreciating others for who they are becomes a reward. As they

practice this virtue of tolerance, Protagonists will see their lives grow in ways they

could not have imagined.

thoughts about this profile or the website in general. We would love to hear from

you.


Best of luck on your path, Protagonist. It may not be easy, but few things worth doing

are. Ultimately, what matters most is that your path reflects who you really are, deep

within. Our lives are often too full of troubles, conflicts, and worries that lie beyond

our control or matter little in the grand scheme of things. But if you remember to

take a break from time to time and think about your values, dreams, and ideals, the

right path will become just a little clearer of superficial distractions. We modestly

hope that we have lighted a few lanterns along the way too.


Until next time.
