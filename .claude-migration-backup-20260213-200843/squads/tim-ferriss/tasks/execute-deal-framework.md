# Task: Execute DEAL Framework

**Agent:** tim-ferriss-chief, tim-ferriss-productivity
**Type:** Framework Execution
**Duration:** 1-2h
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Purpose

Apply Tim Ferriss's DEAL framework (Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate) to any productivity or lifestyle challenge.

**DNA Source:** thinking_dna.frameworks.primary.DEAL

---

## Input

### Required
```yaml
problem_statement: string     # The challenge or goal
current_situation: string     # Current state (time spent, resources, constraints)
```

### Optional
```yaml
constraints: array            # Any non-negotiable constraints
priority_metric: string       # What to optimize for (time, money, freedom, etc.)
```

---

## Process

### STEP 1: Define (Clarify Desired Outcomes)

**Duration:** 15-30 min

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What do I really want? (Not what I think I should want)
2. What would my ideal day/week/lifestyle look like?
3. What am I optimizing for? (Time, money, freedom, impact?)
4. If I could only work 2 hours per week on this, what would I do?

**Output:**
- Clear outcome statement
- Success metrics (quantifiable)
- Priority ranking

**Example:**
```
Problem: "I need to be more productive"
After Define: "I want 20 extra hours per week for passion projects while maintaining current income"
Metric: Hours freed per week
```

---

### STEP 2: Eliminate (Remove Unnecessary)

**Duration:** 30-60 min

**Tim's Principle:** "Doing something unimportant well does not make it important."

**Process:**
1. **List all current tasks/commitments** (weekly breakdown)
2. **80/20 Analysis:**
   - Which 20% create 80% of desired results?
   - Which 20% create 80% of problems/stress?
3. **Elimination Questions:**
   - "What happens if I don't do this at all?"
   - "Is this productive or just active?"
   - "Am I doing this because it's important or because it's urgent?"

**Ruthless Elimination:**
- Cut the bottom 80% that creates only 20% of results
- Fire toxic clients/relationships
- Selective ignorance (low-information diet)

**Output:**
- Tasks eliminated completely (with rationale)
- Time freed (estimate)
- Risks identified and mitigation

**Example:**
```
Eliminated:
- Morning news consumption (1h/day) → Selective ignorance
- 3 low-value clients (5h/week) → Focus on top 20%
- Daily standup meetings (2.5h/week) → Async updates instead

Time Freed: 21.5 hours/week
```

---

### STEP 3: Automate (Systemize Remaining)

**Duration:** 30-45 min

**Tim's Principle:** "If you do something more than twice, create a system."

**Process:**
1. **Identify Repetitive Tasks**
   - Email management
   - Customer service
   - Data entry
   - Social media
   - Reporting

2. **Automation Strategies:**
   - **Technology:** Zapier, scripts, filters, auto-responders
   - **Batching:** Group similar tasks (check email 2x/day, not 50x)
   - **Templates:** Email templates, SOPs, checklists
   - **Systems:** Passive income "muses", automated workflows

3. **Minimum Effective Dose:**
   - What's the smallest automation that gives biggest return?
   - Don't over-engineer

**Output:**
- Automation plan (what, how, when)
- Tools/tech needed
- Setup time investment
- Time saved (ongoing)

**Example:**
```
Automated:
- Email filters + 2x/day checking (saves 1h/day)
- Customer FAQ bot (saves 3h/week)
- Social media scheduling tool (saves 2h/week)

Setup Time: 4 hours
Time Saved: 12 hours/week ongoing
```

### STEP 4: Liberate (Delegate and Create Freedom)

**Duration:** 30-45 min

**Tim's Principle:** "Focus on your $1000/hr tasks. Delegate your $10/hr tasks."

**Process:**
1. **Calculate Your Real Hourly Value**
   - Annual income goal ÷ 2000 hours = hourly value
   - Anything below that value should be delegated

2. **Delegation Candidates:**
   - Virtual assistants ($4-25/hr)
   - Contractors/freelancers
   - Automation (when possible)

3. **Delegation Protocol:**
   - Create SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
   - Start with $100 test (1 week trial)
   - Use Loom videos for training
   - Test, measure, iterate

4. **Location Independence:**
   - Can this be done remotely?
   - Geographic arbitrage opportunities?
   - Mini-retirement feasibility?

**Output:**
- Delegation plan (what, to whom, cost)
- SOPs created
- Location independence strategy
- Freedom metrics (hours, location options)

**Example:**
```
Delegated:
- Data entry to VA (10h/week @ $10/hr = $400/month)
- Content scheduling to freelancer (4h/week @ $25/hr = $400/month)
- Accounting to bookkeeper (2h/week @ $50/hr = $400/month)

Total Cost: $1200/month
Time Freed: 16 hours/week
ROI: If your time is worth $100/hr, you save $6400/month in value
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Freelance Designer

**Problem:** "I'm working 60 hours/week but barely making ends meet"

**DEAL Analysis:**
- **Define:** Earn $100k/year working 20 hours/week
- **Eliminate:** Fire bottom 50% of clients (low-paying, high-maintenance) → Freed 15h/week
- **Automate:** Email templates, Calendly scheduling, project management tool → Freed 8h/week
- **Liberate:** VA handles client onboarding, invoicing ($400/month) → Freed 5h/week

**Result:** 28 hours freed, increased rates for top clients, same income in 20 hours/week

---

### Example 2: Corporate Employee

**Problem:** "Want to travel but tied to office 9-5"

**DEAL Analysis:**
- **Define:** Negotiate remote work for 3 months/year
- **Eliminate:** Unnecessary meetings (5h/week), interruptions (batching work)
- **Automate:** Email filters, async communication, automated reports
- **Liberate:** Proposal to boss showing no productivity loss if remote

**Result:** Got approval for 1 month remote trial, then extended to permanent hybrid
