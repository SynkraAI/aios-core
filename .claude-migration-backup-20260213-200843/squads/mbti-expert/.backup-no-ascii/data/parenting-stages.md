## Cross-Reference: Parent Type × Child Temperament

| Parent → Child ↓ | NT Parent | NF Parent | SJ Parent | SP Parent |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **NT Child** | Natural alignment; risk of pressure | Good emotional balance | May clash on methods | May lack depth |
| **NF Child** | Needs more emotional warmth | Deep bond; watch co-dependency | May feel stifled | May lack stability |
| **SJ Child** | May feel not "smart enough" | May feel confused | Great alignment | May feel judged |
| **SP Child** | May feel restricted | May feel misunderstood | Likely clash on structure | Natural alignment |

**Key Principle:** The best parenting happens when parents understand their type's natural tendencies AND adapt to the child's needs (which may be very different from their own).

## ABCDE Method for Teaching Emotional Regulation (from ENTP Profile)

For adolescents (12-18), teach this framework:
- **A** — Identify the **Activating event** (what happened)
- **B** — Determine resulting **Beliefs** (what do I believe about this)
- **C** — Consider emotional **Consequences** (how does this make me feel)
- **D** — **Dispute** irrational beliefs (is this really true?)
- **E** — Replace with **Effective**, positive beliefs (what's a healthier way to see this)
