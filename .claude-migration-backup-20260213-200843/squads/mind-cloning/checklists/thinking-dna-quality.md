# Checklist: Thinking DNA Quality

> Minimum score: 7/9 → PASS

---

## Extraction Completeness

- [ ] **Primary framework with 3+ steps** (the expert's "operating system")
- [ ] **5+ documented heuristics** in IF/THEN format
- [ ] **2+ veto heuristics** (when they stop/reject)
- [ ] **Decision pipeline mapped** (Input → Analysis → Selection → Validation)
- [ ] **3+ thinking anti-patterns** (what they never do)
- [ ] **2+ recognition patterns** (what they notice first)
- [ ] **2+ objection responses** (how they handle pushback)
- [ ] **1+ handoff trigger** (when they delegate/stop)
- [ ] **All rules have rationale** (why, not just what)

## Quality Signals

- [ ] Primary framework is **triangulated** (3+ sources confirm)
- [ ] Heuristics are **specific** (not vague generalizations)
- [ ] Veto heuristics reveal **core values** (non-negotiables)
- [ ] Decision pipeline matches **observed behavior** (not idealized)
- [ ] Anti-patterns are **distinct from voice anti-patterns** (thinking ≠ communication)
- [ ] Recognition patterns are **domain-specific** (not generic)
- [ ] Objection responses include **tone shift** information

## Scoring

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 9/9 | **EXCELLENT** | Proceed with confidence |
| 7-8/9 | **PASS** | Proceed, minor gaps acceptable |
| 5-6/9 | **NEEDS WORK** | Re-extract weak phases |
| <5/9 | **FAIL** | Significant rework needed |
