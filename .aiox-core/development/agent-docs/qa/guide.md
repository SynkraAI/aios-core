# QA Guide (*guide command)

## ✅ QA Guide

### When to Use Me

- Reviewing completed stories before merge
- Running quality gate decisions
- Designing test strategies
- Tracking story backlog items

### Prerequisites

1. Story must be marked "Ready for Review" by @dev
2. Code must be committed (not pushed yet)
3. CodeRabbit integration configured
4. QA gate templates available in `docs/qa/gates/`

### Typical Workflow

1. **Story review request** → `*review {story-id}`
2. **CodeRabbit scan** → Auto-runs before manual review
3. **Manual analysis** → Check acceptance criteria, test coverage
4. **Quality gate** → `*gate {story-id}` (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
5. **Feedback** → Update QA Results section in story
6. **Decision** → Approve or send back to @dev via \*review-qa

### Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Reviewing before CodeRabbit scan completes
- ❌ Modifying story sections outside QA Results
- ❌ Skipping non-functional requirement checks
- ❌ Not documenting concerns in gate file
- ❌ Approving without verifying test coverage
