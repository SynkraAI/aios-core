# Curation Principles

Reference data for content curation methodology based on Alan Nicolas' principles.

## The 40/20/40 Rule

| Phase | Weight | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Curadoria** | 40% | Selecting and organizing the RIGHT sources |
| **Prompt** | 20% | The extraction prompts and methodology |
| **Refinamento** | 40% | Iterating and improving the output |

**Implication:** The quality of your clone is 80% determined by what you feed it (curation) and how you refine it (iteration), NOT by the prompt itself.

## The Sacred Trinity (Trindade Sagrada)

Every complete mind clone must contain all three:

### 1. Playbook = Recipe (Step-by-Step)
- **What:** The expert's repeatable processes
- **Maps to:** Primary Framework, Secondary Frameworks
- **Example:** "Step 1: Diagnose, Step 2: Prescribe, Step 3: Validate"
- **Quality signal:** Can someone follow it and get similar results?

### 2. Framework = Form (IF/THEN)
- **What:** Decision rules and heuristics
- **Maps to:** Heuristics, Veto Rules, Decision Architecture
- **Example:** "IF revenue < costs for 3 months THEN pivot immediately"
- **Quality signal:** Are the conditions specific enough to be actionable?

### 3. Swipe File = Examples (Proof)
- **What:** Real cases, stories, and evidence
- **Maps to:** Recurring Stories, Anecdotes, Case References
- **Example:** "When I worked with Company X, we applied this and got Y result"
- **Quality signal:** Are the examples specific (names, numbers, dates)?

## Gold vs Bronze Content

### Identifying Gold Content

Gold content reveals the REAL person behind the public persona:

| Gold Type | Why It's Gold | Where to Find |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Q&A responses | Unscripted, reveals real thinking | Comments, AMAs, live sessions |
| Long interviews | Can't maintain facade for 2+ hours | Podcasts, YouTube interviews |
| Stories answering questions | Shows how they actually reason | Instagram/YouTube stories |
| Books (self-written) | Deep, structured thinking | Published works |
| Real case analysis | Shows methodology in action | Blog posts, talks, courses |
| Unscripted moments | Raw reactions reveal true self | Live streams, behind-the-scenes |

### Identifying Bronze Content

Bronze content is common but low-value:

| Bronze Type | Why It's Bronze | Issue |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Old content | Views may have evolved | Outdated mental models |
| Generic material | Not distinctive | Could be anyone |
| Repetitive talks | Same keynote recycled | No new signal |
| Third-party content | Filtered through others | Lost nuance |
| Short-form | Too edited/polished | Loses contradictions |
| AI-generated | Hallucinated patterns | False signal |

### The Gold Rule

> "Less gold content is worth MORE than lots of bronze content."

**Practical example:**
- 3 hours of unscripted podcast interviews (GOLD) > 20 hours of keynote talks (BRONZE)
- 1 book written by the expert > 10 articles written about them
- 5 genuine Q&A responses > 50 curated social media posts

## Triangulation Principle

> "Single source = hypothesis; three sources = pattern"

### How to Triangulate

1. **Identify a claim** from Source A (e.g., "Expert always starts with diagnosis")
2. **Search for confirmation** in Source B (e.g., interview mentions same approach)
3. **Find third reference** in Source C (e.g., book chapter describes the process)
4. **Pattern confirmed** → Mark as validated in DNA

### Triangulation Levels

| Level | Sources | Confidence | Action |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Hypothesis** | 1 source | Low | Flag with ⚠️, don't build rules on it |
| **Corroborated** | 2 sources | Medium | Include with note |
| **Pattern** | 3+ sources | High | Include as core DNA |
| **Axiom** | 5+ sources | Very High | Mark as fundamental to identity |

### What to Triangulate (Priority)

1. **Primary Framework** (MUST be triangulated - blocking)
2. **Power Words** (at least top 5 must appear in 3+ sources)
3. **Recurring Stories** (must appear in 2+ different contexts)
4. **Core Heuristics** (must be confirmable across sources)
5. **Anti-patterns** (what they NEVER do - must be consistent)

## Curation Workflow

```
1. COLLECT raw sources (quantity)
2. CLASSIFY by tier (quality assessment)
3. PRIORITIZE gold over bronze (quality > quantity)
4. TRIANGULATE key patterns (validation)
5. EXTRACT DNA from validated patterns (extraction)
6. REFINE through smoke tests (iteration)
```
