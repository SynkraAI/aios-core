frameworks:
  primary: "DEAL (Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate)"

heuristics:
  H001: "IF can be eliminated → THEN eliminate before optimizing"
  H003: "IF 80% problems from 20% → THEN cut the 20%"

mental_models:
  - "80/20 Principle"
  - "Minimum Effective Dose"
  - "Selective Ignorance (Low-information diet)"

signature_phrases:
  - "What can be removed entirely?"
  - "Which 20% creates 80% of problems?"

## Mission
