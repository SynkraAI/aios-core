# Task: Run Fear-Setting Analysis

**Agent:** tim-ferriss-chief
**Type:** Decision-Making Framework
**Duration:** 30-60 min
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Purpose

Use Fear-Setting (not goal-setting) to make scary decisions by mapping worst-case scenarios and realizing most fears are irrational.

**DNA Source:** thinking_dna.frameworks.secondary.fear_setting

---

## Input

```yaml
decision: string              # The scary decision you're facing
paralysis_reason: string      # Why you're stuck (fear of what?)
```

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define - Worst Case Scenario (10 min)

**Question:** "What is the absolute worst that could happen if I do this?"

Be specific. List 3-10 worst outcomes:
1. [Worst outcome 1]
2. [Worst outcome 2]
3. [Worst outcome 3]
...

**Rate impact:** 1-10 (how bad?)

---

### Step 2: Prevent - How to Reduce Likelihood (10 min)

**Question:** "What steps could I take to prevent worst case?"

For each worst outcome, list prevention strategies:
- [Prevention 1]
- [Prevention 2]
...

---

### Step 3: Repair - Recovery Plan (10 min)

**Question:** "If worst case happens, what could I do to repair?"

For each worst outcome, design recovery:
- [Repair action 1]
- [Repair action 2]
...

**Tim's Insight:** "Most worst cases are reversible or recoverable."

---

### Step 4: Benefits of Attempt (10 min)

**Question:** "What are benefits of an attempt or partial success?"

List 5-10 potential upsides:
1. [Benefit 1]
2. [Benefit 2]
...

**Rate likelihood:** 1-10 (how likely?)

---

### Step 5: Cost of Inaction (15 min)

**Most Critical Question:** "What is the cost of NOT taking this action?"

**Timeframes:**
- 6 months: [Cost of inaction]
- 1 year: [Cost of inaction]
- 3 years: [Cost of inaction]

**Tim's Principle:** "People overestimate risks and underestimate ability to recover. They underestimate cost of inaction."

## Output

### Fear-Setting Worksheet

```markdown
# Fear-Setting Analysis: [Decision]

## 1. Define Worst Case
| Worst Outcome | Impact (1-10) |
|---------------|---------------|
| [Outcome 1]   | [Rating]      |
| [Outcome 2]   | [Rating]      |

## 2. Prevent
| Worst Outcome | Prevention Steps |
|---------------|------------------|
| [Outcome 1]   | [Steps]          |

## 3. Repair
| Worst Outcome | Recovery Plan |
|---------------|---------------|
| [Outcome 1]   | [Plan]        |

## 4. Benefits of Attempt
| Benefit | Likelihood (1-10) |
|---------|-------------------|
| [Benefit 1] | [Rating]      |

## 5. Cost of Inaction
**6 months:** [Cost]
**1 year:** [Cost]
**3 years:** [Cost]

## Decision
Based on this analysis:
- [ ] Worst case is [manageable / catastrophic]
- [ ] Prevention measures [exist / don't exist]
- [ ] Recovery is [possible / impossible]
- [ ] Benefits [outweigh / don't outweigh] risks
- [ ] Cost of inaction is [high / low]

**Recommendation:** [Go / No-Go + rationale]
```

## Example: Quitting Job to Start Business

**Define Worst Case:**
1. Business fails after 6 months (Impact: 7/10)
2. Lose all savings ($20k) (Impact: 8/10)
3. Can't get comparable job back (Impact: 6/10)

**Prevent:**
1. Validate business idea with $100 test first
2. Save 6 months emergency fund before quitting
3. Keep network warm, stay in touch with industry

**Repair:**
1. If fails: Return to job market (demand is high for my skills)
2. If lose savings: Live with parents temporarily, rebuild
3. If can't get same role: Adjacent roles, freelance, or lower

**Benefits of Attempt:**
1. Own business with 2x income potential (Likelihood: 6/10)
2. Time freedom and location independence (8/10)
3. Learning entrepreneurship (10/10)
4. No regrets at 65 (10/10)

**Cost of Inaction:**
- 6 months: Still in unfulfilling job, no progress on dream
- 1 year: Resentment builds, golden handcuffs tighten
- 3 years: Regret not trying, probably still in same job

**Decision:** GO - Worst case is recoverable, cost of inaction is high.
