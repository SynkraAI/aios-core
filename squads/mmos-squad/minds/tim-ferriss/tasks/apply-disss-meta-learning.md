**Agent:** tim-ferriss-meta-learning
**Type:** Skill Acquisition Framework
**Duration:** 2-4h (per skill)
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Purpose

Use DiSSS + CaFE framework to learn any skill faster. Goal: 80% competence in 20% of expected time.

**DNA Source:** thinking_dna.frameworks.secondary.DiSSS

## Input

```yaml
skill_target: string          # The skill to learn (e.g., "Conversational Spanish", "React hooks")
current_level: string         # Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
timeframe: string             # Target deadline (e.g., "3 months", "6 weeks")
success_criteria: string      # What "good enough" looks like
```

---

## Process

### Phase 1: DiSSS (Deconstruction → Selection → Sequencing → Stakes)

#### D - Deconstruction (30-60 min)

**Break skill into smallest learnable units:**
1. Research: Find world-class practitioners
2. Analyze: What are the fundamental components?
3. List: Create complete inventory of sub-skills

**Questions:**
- "What are the minimal components of this skill?"
- "How do top 1% practitioners practice differently?"
- "What's the core technique that unlocks the rest?"

**Output:** Skill component tree

#### S - Selection (30-45 min)

**Find the critical 20% that unlocks 80%:**
1. Identify high-frequency components
2. Find dependencies (what unlocks what?)
3. Prioritize by leverage

**Tim's Principle:** "Which sub-skills are used most often? Which unlock others?"

**Output:** Priority-ranked list of critical components

#### S - Sequencing (20-30 min)

**Design optimal learning order:**
1. Start with highest-leverage components
2. Consider motivation (early wins)
3. Build on previous learning

**Output:** Learning sequence (numbered steps)

#### S - Stakes (15-20 min)

**Create real consequences:**
1. Public commitment
2. Money on the line ($100+ bet)
3. Accountability partner
4. Competition/deadline

**Tim's Principle:** "Stakes create necessity. Necessity drives learning."

**Output:** Commitment mechanism

### Phase 2: CaFE (Compression → Frequency → Encoding)

#### C - Compression (20-30 min)

**Find patterns and create mnemonics:**
- What patterns repeat?
- What's the underlying system?
- How can I compress this into a mental model?

**Output:** Pattern list + mnemonics

#### F - Frequency (15-20 min)

**Design spaced repetition:**
- Daily practice? Weekly review?
- Anki flashcards for memorization
- Habit stacking

**Output:** Practice schedule

#### E - Encoding (15-20 min)

**Multi-sensory + contextual learning:**
- Visual: diagrams, videos
- Kinesthetic: hands-on practice
- Contextual: real-world application

**Output:** Encoding strategy

## Example: Learning Conversational Spanish (3 months)

**Deconstruction:**
- Pronunciation (5 vowels, consonants)
- High-frequency vocabulary (1000 words = 80% of conversation)
- Basic grammar (present tense, common verbs)
- Survival phrases

**Selection (Critical 20%):**
1. Top 100 most common words (covers 50% of speech)
2. Present tense conjugation (ser, estar, tener, ir, haber)
3. Question words (qué, cómo, dónde, cuándo, por qué)
4. Pronunciation of 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, u)

**Sequencing:**
- Week 1-2: Top 100 words + pronunciation
- Week 3-4: Present tense verbs
- Week 5-8: Conversation practice (1h/day)
- Week 9-12: Immersion (Spanish-only contexts)

**Stakes:**
- $500 bet with friend: Must have 15-min conversation by week 12
- Public commitment on social media

**Compression:**
- Verb conjugation pattern: -ar, -er, -ir endings
- Mnemonic: "SHOE verbs" (Singular He/She, Plural We)

**Frequency:**
- Daily: 30 min Anki flashcards (top 1000 words)
- Daily: 15 min conversation with tutor (italki)
- Weekly: 1 movie/show in Spanish (no subtitles)

**Encoding:**
- Visual: Spanish films, flashcards with images
- Kinesthetic: Speaking aloud, shadowing native speakers
- Contextual: Order food in Spanish, travel to Spanish-speaking area
