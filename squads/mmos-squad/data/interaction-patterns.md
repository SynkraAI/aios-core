## Duo Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Collaborative Exchange

**Best for:** Complementary expertise, building on ideas

**Structure:**
1. Clone A introduces perspective
2. Clone B builds on it with their angle
3. Clone A synthesizes both views
4. (repeat until natural conclusion)

**Example topic:** "How to think about career decisions"
- Naval focuses on leverage and specific knowledge
- Nassim adds antifragility and optionality
- Both build a richer framework together

**Turn flow:**
```
A → B → A → B → ...
```

---

### Pattern 2: Respectful Debate

**Best for:** Genuine disagreements, exploring tensions

**Structure:**
1. Clone A states position
2. Clone B presents counter-view
3. Clone A acknowledges valid points, refines
4. Clone B does the same
5. Both find common ground or agree to disagree

**Example topic:** "Should AI development be slowed?"
- Sam argues for iterative deployment
- Nassim argues for extreme precaution
- Natural tension with learning opportunity

**Turn flow:**
```
A (thesis) → B (antithesis) → A (refined) → B (refined) → synthesis or agree-to-disagree
```

---

### Pattern 3: Interview Style

**Best for:** One clone as interviewer, other as subject

**Structure:**
1. Interviewer asks question
2. Subject responds in depth
3. Interviewer follows up
4. (3-5 exchanges per topic)

**Example:** Naval interviews Sam about AI
- Naval asks probing questions in his style
- Sam responds authentically
- Creates unique content neither would produce alone

**Turn flow:**
```
Interviewer → Subject → Interviewer (follow-up) → Subject → ...
```

---

### Pattern 4: Joint Problem Solving

**Best for:** User brings a problem, both clones advise

**Structure:**
1. User presents problem
2. Clone A gives initial perspective
3. Clone B adds different angle
4. Clones discuss/refine
5. Joint recommendations emerge

**Turn flow:**
```
User → A → B → A+B discussion → joint output
```

---

## Roundtable Patterns

### Pattern 1: Structured Rounds

**Best for:** Comprehensive exploration, formal discussions

**Round structure:**
1. **Opening Round:** Each clone states position (1 turn each)
2. **Response Round:** Each responds to others (1 turn each)
3. **Insight Round:** Key takeaway from each (1 turn each)
4. **Synthesis:** Moderator summarizes

**Example with 3 clones:**
```
Round 1: A → B → C (opening positions)
Round 2: A → B → C (responses)
Round 3: A → B → C (insights)
Synthesis: Moderator
```

**Total turns:** 9 clone turns + synthesis

---

### Pattern 2: Open Discussion

**Best for:** Dynamic conversation, natural flow

**Structure:**
- Opening from each clone
- Then free-flowing discussion
- Moderator ensures all contribute
- Natural conclusion

**Speaker selection:**
1. Who was addressed/mentioned
2. Who has relevant expertise for point raised
3. Who has spoken least recently
4. Natural conversation cues

**Example flow:**
```
A → B (responds to A) → C (adds perspective) → A (reacts to C) → B → C → A → synthesis
```

---

### Pattern 3: Topic Rotation

**Best for:** Multi-faceted topics, comprehensive coverage

**Structure:**
- Identify 3-4 sub-topics
- Each clone leads on one sub-topic
- Others contribute to each
- Moderator tracks coverage

**Example:** "Future of work" with 3 clones
- Sub-topic 1: AI impact (led by Sam)
- Sub-topic 2: Human skills (led by Naval)
- Sub-topic 3: Risk/resilience (led by Nassim)

---

### Pattern 4: Debate Format

**Best for:** Controversial topics, clear positions

**Structure:**
- Topic with clear sides/positions
- Clones assigned or choose positions
- Structured arguments and rebuttals
- Audience (user) decides or moderator summarizes

**Format:**
```
Opening statements (each clone)
First rebuttal round
Second rebuttal round
Closing statements
Synthesis
```

## Topic Generation Guidelines

### For Complementary Clones

Find intersection of their domains:
- Naval + Nassim → Decision-making, risk, wealth
- Sam + Nassim → Technology risk, innovation
- Naval + Sam → Startups, technology, leverage

### For Contrasting Clones

Find productive tension:
- Different approaches to same goal
- Different values applied to same situation
- Different time horizons

### Meta-Topics (Work for Any Combo)

- "How do you think about success?"
- "What's the biggest mistake people make in X?"
- "If you were starting over, what would you do differently?"
- "How should someone think about [current event]?"
- "What's underrated in [shared domain]?"

---

## Moderation Guidelines

### Ensuring Participation

- Track turns per clone
- Explicitly invite quiet clones: "What's your take on this, [Name]?"
- Don't let one clone dominate

### Managing Disagreements

- Allow genuine disagreement (valuable content)
- Prevent repetitive back-and-forth
- Know when to move to synthesis
- Frame disagreements as "different perspectives" not conflict

### Quality Control

- Keep responses focused (2-4 paragraphs per turn)
- Prevent repetition of points already made
- Ensure each turn adds value
- Cut off if going in circles

### Natural Conclusion Signs

- Key points have been made by all
- Agreement reached on core insights
- Disagreements clarified and understood
- No new ground being covered
- User has what they need

## Transition Phrases

### Starting Interaction

- "I'd like to explore [topic] with both/all of you."
- "Let's discuss [topic]. [Name], would you start?"
- "This is a great topic for diverse perspectives."

### Mid-Interaction

- "[Name], what's your reaction to that?"
- "Interesting point. [Name], you have a different take?"
- "Let's hear from [Name] who hasn't spoken in a bit."
- "Building on what [Name] said..."

### Moving to Synthesis

- "We've covered a lot. Let me summarize the key points."
- "Before we conclude, any final thoughts?"
- "What's the one thing you'd want [user] to take away?"

### Concluding

- "Great discussion. Here's what emerged..."
- "Thank you both/all. The synthesis follows."
- "Key areas of agreement: ... Key tensions: ..."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### In Duo

- **Serial monologuing:** Clones just taking turns talking, not engaging
- **Excessive agreement:** No productive tension, boring
- **Talking past each other:** Not responding to actual points
- **One dominates:** Unequal contribution

### In Roundtable

- **Too many voices:** Confusing, shallow contributions
- **Ignored clones:** One or more barely participates
- **Endless discussion:** No natural conclusion, rambling
- **Forced disagreement:** Manufacturing conflict that isn't natural
