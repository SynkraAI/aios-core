## Prerequisites

- [ ] Design system has reached a minimum viable product (MVP) state
- [ ] At least one consuming team has been identified for pilot
- [ ] Success metrics have been proposed and agreed upon
- [ ] Dedicated support resources (people or channel) have been allocated

---

## Section 1: Pilot Completion

- [ ] Pilot team has been selected and has agreed to participate
- [ ] Pilot scope is defined (which components, which pages, which timeframe)
- [ ] Pilot team has successfully integrated at least 5 design system components
- [ ] Pilot feedback has been collected and categorized
- [ ] Critical issues from pilot have been resolved before broader rollout
- [ ] Pilot team reports positive or neutral experience (not net-negative)
- [ ] Lessons learned from pilot are documented and incorporated

## Section 2: Documentation Accessibility

- [ ] Documentation site is deployed and accessible to all potential consumers
- [ ] Documentation covers getting started / quick start guide
- [ ] Every published component has a documentation page
- [ ] Documentation includes live, interactive examples
- [ ] Documentation is searchable with relevant results
- [ ] Documentation is versioned to match the design system release
- [ ] Documentation loads quickly and works on mobile devices

## Section 3: Training Materials

- [ ] Getting started tutorial exists for new consumers
- [ ] Video walkthrough or recorded demo is available
- [ ] FAQ document addresses the most common questions
- [ ] Code examples cover the most common use cases per component
- [ ] Migration guide helps teams move from their current solution
- [ ] Training has been delivered to at least one team
- [ ] Self-service learning path is available for asynchronous onboarding

## Section 4: Support Channel

- [ ] Dedicated support channel exists (Slack channel, Teams channel, etc.)
- [ ] Support channel is monitored with defined response SLA (e.g., 24 hours)
- [ ] Bug reporting process is documented and accessible
- [ ] Feature request process is documented and accessible
- [ ] Triage process exists for incoming issues (priority, assignment, timeline)
- [ ] Office hours or regular Q&A sessions are scheduled
- [ ] Escalation path is defined for critical issues

## Section 5: Migration Path

- [ ] Migration guide documents how to adopt the design system incrementally
- [ ] Codemods or automated migration scripts are provided where feasible
- [ ] Side-by-side usage is supported (old components alongside new ones during transition)
- [ ] Breaking changes between old patterns and design system are documented
- [ ] Estimated effort per component migration is provided
- [ ] Migration timeline recommendations exist (suggested rollout phases)
- [ ] Rollback instructions are available if migration causes issues

## Section 6: Success Metrics

- [ ] Adoption rate is tracked (percentage of teams/projects using the design system)
- [ ] Component usage analytics are collected (which components, how often)
- [ ] Developer satisfaction survey is planned (quarterly or biannually)
- [ ] Time-to-implement reduction is measured (before vs. after adoption)
- [ ] Consistency score or visual deviation tracking is in place
- [ ] Support ticket volume and resolution time are monitored
- [ ] Business impact metrics are defined (reduced design/dev time, fewer accessibility issues)
