Source: 16Personalities Premium Profiles (all 16 types)

## Overview

The 16Personalities model structures personal growth around **5 Self-Aspects**,
each with three states: **Balanced** (healthy), **Unbalanced** (unhealthy),
and **Rebalancing** (path to recovery).

### The 5 Aspects

1. **Self-Esteem (Autoestima)** — How you value yourself inherently
2. **Self-Respect (Autorrespeito)** — How you honor your own principles and actions
3. **Self-Confidence (Autoconfiança)** — How you trust your abilities and express yourself
4. **Self-Evolution (Autoevolução)** — How you grow, adapt, and embrace change
5. **Self-Responsibility (Autorresponsabilidade)** — How you own your choices and their consequences

## Universal Growth Principles (from source material)

1. **Emotions are facts** — Acknowledging feelings is not weakness; it's data
2. **Action validates theory** — Growth happens through practice, not just thinking
3. **Others are mirrors** — Feedback from different types reveals blind spots
4. **Progress, not position** — Focus on "how far I've come" not "how far to go"
5. **Balanced opposites** — Develop your inferior function for wholeness
6. **Voluntary change** — Practice changing one small habit to build adaptability muscle
7. **Constructive response** — Transform frustration into constructive action
