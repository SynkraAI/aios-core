## Overview

The Hormozi Squad is an expert system built from **165+ source files (165MB)** of Alex Hormozi's documented frameworks, including:

- **4 Complete Books:** $100M Offers, $100M Leads, + 2 more (65+ chapters)
- **25 Playbook Directories:** Detailed process blueprints
- **8 Confirmed Mental Models:** Core decision frameworks
- **95% Fidelity:** Voice DNA + Thinking DNA extracted from primary sources

### Design Philosophy

**"An army of specialized Alex Hormozis, each mastering a specific domain, working in coordination to create offers, leads, ads, copy, and strategies that make people feel stupid saying no."**

Core Principles:
- **Context First:** All recommendations adapt to industry, price tier, and business stage
- **Data-Driven:** Every decision based on Hormozi's documented frameworks
- **Antipattern Shields:** Immune system blocks common failure architectures
- **Systematic Execution:** 55 tasks, 45 checklists, 9 workflows for repeatable results

---

## Tier Hierarchy

The squad follows a 4-tier hierarchical structure for intelligent routing:

### Tier 0: Orchestration & Diagnosis

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **hormozi-chief** | Orchestrator | Strategic routing, context diagnosis, industry adaptation |

**Purpose:** Entry point for all user interactions. Diagnoses context (industry, price tier, business stage) and routes to appropriate specialists.

**Workflows:**
- `wf-context-diagnosis` - Diagnose industry, price tier, and business stage
- `wf-growth-decision` - Decide between "Mais" (more volume), "Melhor" (better efficiency), or "Novo" (new channel)
- `wf-opportunity-screening` - VETO gate for market validation

---

### Tier 1: Strategic Diagnosis

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **hormozi-audit** | Business Auditor | System diagnostics, constraint identification, KPI analysis |
| **hormozi-advisor** | Strategic Advisor | Long-term strategy, business model design, competitive positioning |

**Purpose:** Deep diagnosis and strategic planning before execution.

**Key Outputs:**
- Business health reports
- Constraint analysis (leads/conversion/delivery/capacity)
- Strategic roadmaps

---

### Tier 2: Domain Specialists (Core Execution)

| Agent | Domain | Specialization |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **hormozi-offers** | Offer Creation | Grand Slam Offers, value equation, stack architecture |

### Workflow Design Patterns

**All workflows follow these principles:**
1. **Checkpoints:** Every phase has completion criteria
2. **Veto Conditions:** Blocking rules prevent wrong paths
3. **Unidirectional Flow:** No backtracking (forces proper diagnosis first)
4. **Data-Driven:** Decisions based on Hormozi's documented frameworks
5. **Human Review Gates:** Strategic decisions require user confirmation

## Quality Gates

### Checklist Coverage (45 checklists)

| Domain | Checklists | Key Validations |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Offers** | 10 | Value equation, bonus stacks, guarantees |
| **Leads** | 7 | Core Four, lead magnets, activation |
| **Pricing** | 6 | Golden ratios, LTV:CAC, pricing frameworks |
| **Copy** | 8 | Hooks, headlines, GOATED ads |
| **Launch** | 6 | Timeline, war room, contingency |
| **Retention** | 5 | Onboarding, churn diagnosis, engagement |
| **General** | 3 | Antipattern screening, market validation |

### Veto Conditions

**Global Veto Rules:**
- `VETO_MISMATCH_001` - Price tier / tactic mismatch (e.g., calls for $97 product)
- `VETO_MISMATCH_002` - Stage / advice mismatch (e.g., optimization for overdelivery stage)
- `VETO_GENERIC_001` - Generic advice without context diagnosis

**Market Validation Vetos:**
- Zero pain → VETO (no desperate need)
- Zero purchasing power → VETO (can't afford)
- Zero accessibility → VETO (can't reach audience)
- Declining market → VETO (shrinking TAM)

**Antipattern Vetos:**
- High churn structure (e.g., startups pre-revenue)
- Commoditized offering without differentiation
- Low LTV:CAC ratio (<3:1)
- Unsustainable scaling (hiring before systemization)

## Next Steps

**For New Users:**
1. Start with `/hormozi:agents:hormozi-chief` for context diagnosis
2. Run `wf-context-diagnosis` to get routing recommendations
3. Follow routing to appropriate specialist agent

**For Squad Maintenance:**
- Review validation report: `docs/validation-report-2026-02-13.md`
- Update source material as new Hormozi content releases
- Expand edge case examples in agents
- Add automation scripts for checklist scoring
