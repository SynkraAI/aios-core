# Quality Validation Checklist - Dopamine Learning Squad

**Purpose:** Validate learning system designs before delivery
**Used by:** dopamine-learning-chief, deterding-intrinsic-validator, kapp-instructional-integrator

---

## Tier 0 Diagnostic Validation

- [ ] Dopamine architecture defines RPE trigger points (Schultz)
- [ ] Behavior model identifies M/A/P gaps (Fogg)
- [ ] Core drives mapped with intrinsic ratio >= 70% (Chou)
- [ ] Flow zone calibrated with challenge-skill boundaries (Csikszentmihalyi)
- [ ] Ethical validation passed - no dark patterns detected (Deterding)
- [ ] All 5 Tier 0 diagnostics integrated coherently

## Tier 1 Execution Validation

- [ ] Learning sequence applies relevant 36 principles (Gee)
- [ ] Scaffolding plan includes fading strategy
- [ ] Engagement loops defined with trigger-action-reward cycles (Eyal)
- [ ] Variable reward strategy avoids extrinsic dependency
- [ ] Narrative framing uses Hero's Journey structure (McGonigal)
- [ ] Feedback architecture distinguishes performance vs learning feedback (Kapp)
- [ ] Assessment measures actual learning, not just completion

## Integration Quality

- [ ] All agent outputs align without contradictions
- [ ] Dopamine signals encode genuine learning progress
- [ ] Drive activation is sustainable (not novelty-dependent)
- [ ] Challenge progression supports flow across all levels
- [ ] Ethical foundation maintained through execution

## Deliverable Completeness

- [ ] Learner profile documented
- [ ] Learning objectives mapped to dopamine triggers
- [ ] Question/challenge bank generated
- [ ] Feedback architecture specified
- [ ] Implementation spec ready for developers
