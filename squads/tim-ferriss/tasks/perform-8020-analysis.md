# Task: Perform 80/20 Analysis

**Agent:** tim-ferriss-productivity, tim-ferriss-chief
**Type:** Prioritization Framework
**Duration:** 30-60 min
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Purpose

Apply Pareto Principle (80/20) to identify vital few (20%) from trivial many (80%) in any domain.

**Tim's Core Belief:** "80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Ruthlessly eliminate the 80%."

**DNA Source:** thinking_dna.mental_models.pareto + heuristic H003

---

## Input

```yaml
domain: string                # What to analyze (tasks, clients, products, habits, etc.)
data: array                   # List of items to analyze
success_metric: string        # How to measure results (revenue, time saved, happiness, etc.)
```

---

## Process

### Step 1: Inventory (10-15 min)

List ALL items in domain:
- If tasks: Complete task list
- If clients: All clients with revenue
- If products: All products with sales
- If habits: All habits with time spent

**Be comprehensive.** You can't analyze what you don't list.

---

### Step 2: Measure Results (10-15 min)

For each item, quantify results:
- Revenue generated
- Time consumed
- Happiness produced
- Problems created

**Use actual data**, not guesses.

---

### Step 3: Rank by Efficiency (10 min)

Calculate ROI or efficiency:
- Revenue per hour
- Happiness per effort
- Results per time invested

Sort by efficiency (highest to lowest).

---

### Step 4: Identify the 20% (5 min)

Top 20% of items (by count) should create ~80% of results.

**Questions:**
- Does the top 20% really create 80% of value?
- If not, what's the actual ratio? (Could be 90/10 or 70/30)

---

### Step 5: Eliminate the 80% (20-30 min)

**Tim's Ruthless Elimination:**
- Bottom 80%: What can be eliminated completely?
- "What happens if I don't do this at all?"
- Fire toxic clients, cut low-value products, delete time-wasting habits

**Options for the 80%:**
1. Eliminate entirely ← PREFER THIS
2. Delegate if can't eliminate
3. Automate if can't delegate
4. Keep only if truly necessary (rare)

## Output

### 80/20 Analysis Report

```markdown
# 80/20 Analysis: [Domain]

## Inventory
**Total Items:** [Number]
**Success Metric:** [What measuring]

## Top 20% (Vital Few)
| Item | Results | Efficiency | Action |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| [Item 1] | [Data] | [ROI] | KEEP + invest more |
| [Item 2] | [Data] | [ROI] | KEEP |
...

**Top 20% generates [X]% of total results**

## Bottom 80% (Trivial Many)
| Item | Results | Efficiency | Action |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| [Item] | [Data] | [ROI] | ELIMINATE |
| [Item] | [Data] | [ROI] | DELEGATE |
...

**Bottom 80% generates only [X]% of results**

## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions:
1. **Eliminate:** [List items to cut completely]
2. **Delegate:** [List items to hand off]
3. **Double Down:** [Invest more in top 20%]

### Expected Impact:
- **Time Freed:** [X hours/week]
- **Results Increase:** [X% by focusing on vital few]
- **Stress Reduction:** [Cut X low-value / high-stress items]

## Implementation Plan:
- [ ] [Action 1] by [date]
- [ ] [Action 2] by [date]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Client Analysis (Freelance Consultant)

**Inventory:** 20 clients
**Metric:** Revenue per hour

**Top 20% (4 clients):**
- Generate 85% of revenue ($170k of $200k)
- Low maintenance, high value
- **Action:** Double down, raise rates slightly

**Bottom 80% (16 clients):**
- Generate 15% of revenue ($30k)
- High maintenance, constant emergencies
- **Action:** Fire 12 clients, keep 4 as "bridge income" while replacing

**Result:** Cut 60% of work, keep 85% of income, massive stress reduction

---

### Example 2: Task List (Knowledge Worker)

**Inventory:** 40 weekly tasks
**Metric:** Impact on goals

**Top 20% (8 tasks):**
- Strategic planning, client calls, content creation
- Generate 80% of career advancement
- **Action:** Protect time for these, schedule first

**Bottom 80% (32 tasks):**
- Email, meetings, admin work, interruptions
- Generate 20% of value but consume 80% of time
- **Action:**
  - Eliminate: 15 tasks (low-value meetings, unnecessary reports)
  - Automate: 10 tasks (email filters, templates)
  - Delegate: 7 tasks (VA handles)

**Result:** 25 hours freed, focus on high-impact work

---

### Example 3: Product Line (E-commerce)

**Inventory:** 50 products
**Metric:** Profit margin

**Top 20% (10 products):**
- Generate 75% of profit
- Low customer service issues
- **Action:** Increase inventory, create upsells

**Bottom 80% (40 products):**
- Generate 25% of profit
- High return rate, customer complaints
- **Action:** Discontinue 30 products, keep 10 as "loss leaders"

**Result:** Simplified operations, better margins, happier customers

---

## Advanced: Inverse 80/20

**Tim's Insight:** Also identify which 20% create 80% of PROBLEMS.

- **Which 20% of clients cause 80% of stress?** → Fire them
- **Which 20% of habits cause 80% of wasted time?** → Eliminate them
- **Which 20% of products cause 80% of customer service?** → Discontinue them
